represent a worldwide view of the subject Please improve this article and discuss the issue on the talk page December School colors are the colors chosen by a school to represent it on uniforms and other items of identification Most schools have two colors which are usually chosen to avoid conflicts with other schools with which the school competes in sports and other activities The colors are often worn to build morale among the teachers and pupils and as an expression of school spirit Uses edit Most competitive teams keep two sets of uniforms with one emphasizing the primary color and the other emphasizing the secondary color In some sports such as American Football the primary color is emphasized on home uniforms while uniforms for other sports notably basketball use the secondary or a neutral color at home This is done to avoid confusing the two schools colors In addition various groups that generate support for athletic teams including cheerleaders and marching bands wear uniforms with the colors of their school School colors have many non athletic purposes as well Members of a university s community will often display them as a sign of support or spirit for their particular institution Likewise during college or university ceremonies those schools which award an academic hood to their students will generally abide by the American Council on Education guidelines and use the school colors on the inside and the disciplinary colors on the outside velvet trim regardless of the ceremony recipients of a degree have the right to wear the hood thereafter Some doctoral robes will also be in the colors of the university which granted the degree At many private schools or more traditional state schools school colours are awards presented for achievement in a subject or a sport See Sporting colours British and Irish Universities traditionally have an Academic scarf in the university s colors usually long woollen and patterned only with lengthwise stripes of varying widths At collegiate universities such as Oxford Cambridge Durham and Lancaster each college has its own colors and scarf Other non collegiate universities such as Glasgow and Newcastle have scarf colors for each faculty Retrieved from http en wikipedia org w index php title School colors amp oldid Categories School terminology School colors Hidden categories Articles
