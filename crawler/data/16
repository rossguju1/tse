free dictionary Sequential redirects here For the manual transmission see sequential manual transmission For other uses see Sequence disambiguation A sequence is an ordered list Like a set it contains members also called elements or terms The number of ordered elements possibly infinite is called the length of the sequence Unlike a set order matters and exactly the same elements can appear multiple times at different positions in the sequence Most precisely a sequence can be defined as a function whose domain is a countable totally ordered set such as the natural numbers For example M A R Y is a sequence of letters with the letter M first and Y last This sequence differs from A R M Y Also the sequence which contains the number at two different positions is a valid sequence Sequences can be finite as in this example or infinite such as the sequence of all even positive integers Finite sequences are sometimes known as strings or words and infinite sequences as streams The empty sequence is included in most notions of sequence but may be excluded depending on the context An infinite sequence of real numbers in blue This sequence is neither increasing nor decreasing nor convergent nor Cauchy It is however bounded Contents Examples and notation Important examples Indexing Specifying a sequence by recursion Definition and basic properties Definition Finite and infinite Increasing and decreasing Bounded Other types of sequences Limits and convergence Definition of convergence Applications and important results Cauchy sequences Series Use in other fields of mathematics Vectors Ordinal indexed sequence Sequences and automata Analysis Infinite sequences in theoretical computer science Abstract algebra Types Related concepts Operations See also References External links Examples and notation edit A sequence can be thought of as a list of elements with a particular order Sequences are useful in a number of mathematical disciplines for studying functions spaces and other mathematical structures using the convergence properties of sequences In particular sequences are the basis for series which are important in differential equations and analysis Sequences are also of interest in their own right and can be studied as patterns or puzzles such as in the study of prime numbers There are a number of ways to denote a sequence some of which are more useful for specific types of sequences One way to specify a sequence is to list the elements For example the first four odd numbers form the sequence This notation can be used for infinite sequences as well For instance the infinite sequence of positive odd integers can be written Listing is most useful for infinite sequences with a pattern that can be easily discerned from the first few elements Other ways to denote a sequence are discussed after the examples Important examples edit A tiling with squares whose sides are successive Fibonacci numbers in length There are many important integer sequences The prime numbers are the natural numbers bigger than that have no divisors but and themselves Taking these in their natural order gives the sequence The study of prime numbers has important applications for mathematics and specifically number theory The Fibonacci numbers are the integer sequence whose elements are the sum of the previous two elements The first two elements are either and or and so that the sequence is Other interesting sequences include the ban numbers whose spellings do not contain a certain letter of the alphabet For instance the eban numbers do not contain e form the sequence Another sequence based on the English spelling of the letters is the one based on their number of letters For a list of important examples of integers sequences see On line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Other important examples of sequences include ones made up of rational numbers real numbers and complex numbers The sequence approaches the number In fact every real number can be written as the limit of a sequence of rational numbers For instance for a sequence the limit of a sequence can be written as It is this fact that allows us to write any real number as the limit of a sequence of decimals The decimal for however does not have any pattern like the one for the sequence Indexing edit Other notations can be useful for sequences whose pattern cannot be easily guessed or for sequences that do not have a pattern such as the digits of This section focuses on the notations used for sequences that are a map from a subset of the natural numbers For generalizations to other countable index sets see the following section and below The terms of a sequence are commonly denoted by a single variable say a n where the index n indicates the nth element of the sequence Indexing notation is used to refer to a sequence in the abstract It is also a natural notation for sequences whose elements are related to the index n the element s position in a simple way For instance the sequence of the first square numbers could be written as This represents the sequence This notation is often simplified further as Here the subscript k and superscript together tell us that the elements of this sequence are the a k such that k Sequences can be indexed beginning and ending from any integer The infinity symbol is often used as the superscript to indicate the sequence including all integer k values starting with a certain one The sequence of all positive squares is then denoted In cases where the set of indexing numbers is understood such as in analysis the subscripts and superscripts are often left off That is one simply writes a k for an arbitrary sequence In analysis k would be understood to run from to However sequences are often indexed starting from zero as in In some cases the elements of the sequence are related naturally to a sequence of integers whose pattern can be easily inferred In these cases the index set may be implied by a listing of the first few abstract elements For instance the sequence of squares of odd numbers could be denoted in any of the following ways Moreover the subscripts and superscripts could have been left off in the third fourth and fifth notations if the indexing set was understood to be the natural numbers Finally sequences can more generally be denoted by writing a set inclusion in the subscript such as in The set of values that the index can take on is called the index set In general the ordering of the elements a k is specified by the order of the elements in the indexing set When N is the index set the element a k comes after the element a k since in N the element k comes directly after the element k Specifying a sequence by recursion edit Sequences whose elements are related to the previous elements in a straightforward way are often specified using recursion This is in contrast to the specification of sequence elements in terms of their position To specify a sequence by recursion requires a rule to construct each consecutive element in terms of the ones before it In addition enough initial elements must be specified so that new elements of the sequence can be specified by the rule The principle of mathematical induction can be used to prove that a sequence is well defined which is to say that that every element of the sequence is specified at least once and has a single unambiguous value Induction can also be used to prove properties about a sequence especially for sequences whose most natural specification is by recursion The Fibonacci sequence can be defined using a recursive rule along with two initial elements The rule is that each element is the sum of the previous two elements and the first two elements are and with a and a The first ten terms of this sequence are and A more complicated example of a sequence that is defined recursively is Recaman s sequence considered at the beginning of this section We can define Recaman s sequence by a and a n a n n if the result is positive and not already in the list Otherwise a n a n n Not all sequences can be specified by a rule in the form of an equation recursive or not and some can be quite complicated For example the sequence of prime numbers is the set of prime numbers in their natural order This gives the sequence Definition and basic properties edit There are many different notions of sequences in mathematics some of which e g exact sequence are not covered by the definitions and notations introduced below Definition edit A sequence is usually defined as a function whose domain is a countable totally ordered set although in many disciplines the domain is restricted such as to the natural numbers In real analysis a sequence is a function from a subset of the natural numbers to the real numbers In other words a sequence is a map f n N R To recover our earlier notation we might identify a n f n for all n or just write a n N R In complex analysis sequences are defined as maps from the natural numbers to the complex numbers C In topology sequences are often defined as functions from a subset of the natural numbers to a topological space Sequences are an important concept for studying functions and in topology topological spaces An important generalization of sequences called a net is to functions from a possibly uncountable directed set to a topological space Finite and infinite edit The length of a sequence is defined as the number of terms in the sequence A sequence of a finite length n is also called an n tuple Finite sequences include the empty sequence that has no elements Normally the term infinite sequence refers to a sequence which is infinite in one direction and finite in the other the sequence has a first element but no final element a singly infinite sequence A sequence that is infinite in both directions it has neither a first nor a final element is called a bi infinite sequence two way infinite sequence or doubly infinite sequence For instance a function from all integers into a set such as the sequence of all even integers is bi infinite This sequence could be denoted Formally a bi infinite sequence can be defined as a mapping from Z One can interpret singly infinite sequences as elements of the semigroup ring of the natural numbers R N and doubly infinite sequences as elements of the group ring of the integers R Z This perspective is used in the Cauchy product of sequences Increasing and decreasing edit A sequence is said to be monotonically increasing if each term is greater than or equal to the one before it For a sequence this can be written as a n a n for all n N If each consecutive term is strictly greater than gt the previous term then the sequence is called strictly monotonically increasing A sequence is monotonically decreasing if each consecutive term is less than or equal to the previous one and strictly monotonically decreasing if each is strictly less than the previous If a sequence is either increasing or decreasing it is called a monotone sequence This is a special case of the more general notion of a monotonic function The terms nondecreasing and nonincreasing are often used in place of increasing and decreasing in order to avoid any possible confusion with strictly increasing and strictly decreasing respectively Bounded edit If the sequence of real numbers a n is such that all the terms after a certain one are less than some real number M then the sequence is said to be bounded from above In less words this means a n M for all n greater than N for some pair M and N Any such M is called an upper bound Likewise if for some real m a n m for all n greater than some N then the sequence is bounded from below and any such m is called a lower bound If a sequence is both bounded from above and bounded from below then the sequence is said to be bounded Other types of sequences edit A subsequence of a given sequence is a sequence formed from the given sequence by deleting some of the elements without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining elements For instance the sequence of positive even integers is a subsequence of the positive integers The positions of some elements change when other elements are deleted However the relative positions are preserved Some other types of sequences that are easy to define include An integer sequence is a sequence whose terms are integers A polynomial sequence is a sequence whose terms are polynomials A positive integer sequence is sometimes called multiplicative if a nm a n a m for all pairs n m such that n and m are coprime In other instances sequences are often called multiplicative if a n na for all n Moreover the multiplicative Fibonacci sequence satisfies the recursion relation a n a n a n Limits and convergence edit Main article Limit of a sequence The plot of a convergent sequence a n is shown in blue Visually we can see that the sequence is converging to the limit zero as n increases One of the most important properties of a sequence is convergence Informally a sequence converges if it has a limit Continuing informally a singly infinite sequence has a limit if it approaches some value L called the limit as n becomes very large That is for an abstract sequence a n with n running from to infinity understood the value of a n approaches L as n denoted More precisely the sequence converges if there exists a limit L such that the remaining a n s are arbitrarily close to L for some n large enough If a sequence converges to some limit then it is convergent otherwise it is divergent If a n gets arbitrarily large as n we write In this case the sequence a n diverges or that it converges to infinity If a n becomes arbitrarily small negative numbers large in magnitude as n we write and say that the sequence diverges or converges to minus infinity Definition of convergence edit For sequences that can be written as with a n R we can write a n with the indexing set understood as N These sequences are most common in real analysis The generalizations to other types of sequences are considered in the following section and the main page Limit of a sequence Let a n be a sequence In words the sequence a n is said to converge if there exists a number L such that no matter how close we want the a n to be to L say close where gt we can find a natural number N such that all terms a N a N are further closer to L within of L This is often written more compactly using symbols For instance for all gt there exists a natural number N such that L lt a n lt L for all n N In even more compact notation The difference in the definitions of convergence for one sided sequences in complex analysis and metric spaces is that the absolute value a n L is interpreted as the distance in the complex plane and the distance under the appropriate metric respectively Applications and important results edit Important results for convergence and limits of one sided sequences of real numbers include the following These equalities are all true at least when both sides exist For a discussion of when the existence of the limit on one side implies the existence of the other see a real analysis text such as can be found in the references The limit of a sequence is unique provided If a n b n for all n greater than some N then Squeeze Theorem If for all n gt N and then If a sequence is bounded and monotonic then it is convergent A sequence is convergent if and only if every subsequence is convergent Cauchy sequences edit Main article Cauchy sequence The plot of a Cauchy sequence x n shown in blue as x n versus n Visually we see that the sequence appears to be converging to the limit zero as the terms in the sequence become closer together as n increases In the real numbers every Cauchy sequence converges to some limit A Cauchy sequence is a sequence whose terms become arbitrarily close together as n gets very large The notion of a Cauchy sequence is important in the study of sequences in metric spaces and in particular in real analysis One particularly important result in real analysis is Cauchy characterization of convergence for sequences A sequence is convergent if and only if it is Cauchy Series edit Main article Series mathematics A series is informally speaking the sum of the terms of a sequence That is adding the first N terms of a one sided sequence forms the Nth term of another sequence called a series Thus the N series of the sequence a n results in another sequence S N given by We can also write the n th term of the series as Then the concepts used to talk about sequences such as convergence carry over to series the sequence of partial sums and the properties can be characterized as properties of the underlying sequences such as a n in the last example The limit if it exists of an infinite series the series created from an infinite sequence is written as Use in other fields of mathematics edit This section is incomplete January Vectors edit Sequences over a field may also be viewed as vectors in a vector space Specifically the set of F valued sequences where F is a field is a function space in fact a product space of F valued functions over the set of natural numbers Ordinal indexed sequence edit An ordinal indexed sequence is a generalization of a sequence If is a limit ordinal and X is a set an indexed sequence of elements of X is a function from to X In this terminology an indexed sequence is an ordinary sequence Sequences and automata edit Automata or finite state machines can typically be thought of as directed graphs with edges labeled using some specific alphabet Most familiar types of automata transition from state to state by reading input letters from following edges with matching labels the ordered input for such an automaton forms a sequence called a word or input word The sequence of states encountered by the automaton when processing a word is called a run A nondeterministic automaton may have unlabeled or duplicate out edges for any state giving more than one successor for some input letter This is typically thought of as producing multiple possible runs for a given word each being a sequence of single states rather than producing a single run that is a sequence of sets of states however run is occasionally used to mean the latter Analysis edit In analysis when talking about sequences one will generally consider sequences of the form which is to say infinite sequences of elements indexed by natural numbers It may be convenient to have the sequence start with an index different from or For example the sequence defined by x n log n would be defined only for n When talking about such infinite sequences it is usually sufficient and does not change much for most considerations to assume that the members of the sequence are defined at least for all indices large enough that is greater than some given N The most elementary type of sequences are numerical ones that is sequences of real or complex numbers This type can be generalized to sequences of elements of some vector space In analysis the vector spaces considered are often function spaces Even more generally one can study sequences with elements in some topological space Infinite sequences in theoretical computer science edit Infinite sequences of digits or characters drawn from a finite alphabet are of particular interest in theoretical computer science They are often referred to simply as sequences or streams as opposed to finite strings Infinite binary sequences for instance are infinite sequences of bits characters drawn from the alphabet The set C of all infinite binary sequences is sometimes called the Cantor space An infinite binary sequence can represent a formal language a set of strings by setting the n th bit of the sequence to if and only if the n th string in shortlex order is in the language Therefore the study of complexity classes which are sets of languages may be regarded as studying sets of infinite sequences An infinite sequence drawn from the alphabet b may also represent a real number expressed in the base b positional number system This equivalence is often used to bring the techniques of real analysis to bear on complexity classes In particular the term sequence space usually refers to a linear subspace of the set of all possible infinite sequences with elements in C Abstract algebra edit If A is a set the free monoid over A denoted A is a monoid containing all the finite sequences or strings of zero or more elements of A with the binary operation of concatenation The free semigroup A is the subsemigroup of A containing all elements except the empty sequence Types edit sequence Arithmetic progression Cauchy sequence Farey sequence Fibonacci
