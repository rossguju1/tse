Wikipedia the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation search Coalesced Hashing example For purposes of this example collision buckets are allocated in increasing order starting with bucket Coalesced hashing also called coalesced chaining is a strategy of collision resolution in a hash table that forms a hybrid of separate chaining and open addressing In a separate chaining hash table items that hash to the same address are placed on a list or chain at that address This technique can result in a great deal of wasted memory because the table itself must be large enough to maintain a load factor that performs well typically twice the expected number of items and extra memory must be used for all but the first item in a chain unless list headers are used in which case extra memory must be used for all items in a chain Given a sequence qrj aty qur dim ofu gcl rhv clq ecd qsu of randomly generated three character long strings the following table would be generated using Bob Jenkins One at a Time hash algorithm with a table of size null clq qur null null dim aty qsu rhv qrj ofu gcl ecd null This strategy is effective efficient and very easy to implement However sometimes the extra memory use might be prohibitive and the most common alternative open addressing has uncomfortable disadvantages that decrease performance The primary disadvantage of open addressing is primary and secondary clustering in which searches may access long sequences of used buckets that contain items with different hash addresses items with one hash address can thus lengthen searches for items with other hash addresses One solution to these issues is coalesced hashing Coalesced hashing uses a similar technique as separate chaining but instead of allocating new nodes for the linked list buckets in the actual table are used The first empty bucket in the table at the time of a collision is considered the collision bucket When a collision occurs anywhere in the table the item is placed in the collision bucket and a link is made between the chain and the collision bucket It is possible for a newly inserted item to collide with items with a different hash address such as the case in the example above when item clq is inserted The chain for clq is said to coalesce with the chain of qrj hence the name of the algorithm However the extent of coalescing is minor compared with the clustering exhibited by open addressing For example when coalescing occurs the length of the chain grows by only whereas in open addressing search sequences of arbitrary length may combine An important optimization to reduce the effect of coalescing is to restrict the address space of the hash function to only a subset of the table For example if the table has size M with buckets numbered from to M we can restrict the address space so that the hash function only assigns addresses to the first N locations in the table The remaining M N buckets called the cellar are used exclusively for storing items that collide during insertion No coalescing can occur until the cellar is exhausted The optimal choice of N relative to M depends upon the load factor or fullness of the table A careful analysis shows that the value N M yields near optimum performance for most load factors Other variants for insertion are also possible that have improved search time Deletion algorithms have been developed that preserve randomness and thus the average search time analysis still holds after deletions Insertion in C htab is the hash table N is the size of the address space of the hash function and M is the size of the entire table including the cellar Collision buckets are allocated in decreasing order starting with bucket M int insert char key unsigned h hash key strlen key N if htab h NULL Make a new chain htab h make node key NULL else struct node it int cursor M Find the first empty bucket while cursor gt amp amp htab cursor NULL cursor The table is full terminate unsuccessfully if cursor return htab cursor make node key NULL Find the last node in the chain and point to it it htab h while it gt next NULL it it gt next it gt next htab cursor return One benefit of this strategy is that the search algorithm for separate chaining can be used without change in a coalesced hash table Lookup in C char find char key unsigned h hash key strlen key N if htab h NULL struct node it Search the chain at index h for it htab h it NULL it it gt next if strcmp key it gt data return it gt data return NULL Performance edit Coalesced chaining avoids the effects of primary and secondary clustering and as a result can take advantage of the efficient search algorithm for separate chaining If the chains are short this strategy is very efficient and can be highly condensed memory wise As in open addressing deletion from a coalesced hash table is awkward and potentially expensive and resizing the table is terribly expensive and should be done rarely if ever References edit a b J S
