McIlroy and Joe Ossanna at Bell Labs Programmed in C and Assembly language OS family Unix Working state Current Source model Historically closed source now some Unix projects BSD family and Illumos are open sourced Initial release years ago Available language s English Kernel type Monolithic Default user interface Command line interface amp Graphical X Window System License Varies some versions are proprietary others are free open source software Official website unix org Unix officially trademarked as UNIX is a multitasking multi user computer operating system that exists in many variants The original Unix was developed at AT amp T s Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson Dennis Ritchie and others From the power user s or programmer s perspective Unix systems are characterized by a modular design that is sometimes called the Unix philosophy meaning the OS provides a set of simple tools that each perform a limited well defined function with a unified filesystem as the main means of communication and a shell scripting and command language to combine the tools to perform complex workflows The C programming language was designed by Dennis Ritchie as a systems programming language for Unix allowing for portability beyond the initial PDP development platform and the use of Unix on a plethora of computing platforms During the late s and s Unix developed into a standard operating system for academia AT amp T tried to commercialize it by licensing the OS to third party vendors leading to a variety of both academic e g BSD and commercial variants of Unix such as Xenix and eventually to the Unix wars between groups of vendors AT amp T finally sold its rights in Unix to Novell in the early s The Open Group an industry standards consortium now owns the UNIX trademark and allows its use for certified operating systems compliant with its standard the Single UNIX Specification Other operating systems that emulate Unix to some extent may be called Unix like although the Open Group disapproves of this term The term Unix is also often used informally to denote any operating system that closely resembles the trademarked system The most common version of Unix bearing certification is Apple s OS X while Linux is the most popular non certified workalike Contents Overview History Standards Components Impact Free Unix and Unix like operating systems ARPANET Branding See also References Further reading External links Overview edit Version Unix the Research Unix ancestor of all modern Unix systems Originally Unix was meant to be a programmer s workbench to be used for developing software to be run on multiple platforms more than to be used to run application software The system grew larger as the operating system started spreading in the academic circle as users added their own tools to the system and shared them with colleagues Unix was designed to be portable multi tasking and multi user in a time sharing configuration Unix systems are characterized by various concepts the use of plain text for storing data a hierarchical file system treating devices and certain types of inter process communication IPC as files and the use of a large number of software tools small programs that can be strung together through a command line interpreter using pipes as opposed to using a single monolithic program that includes all of the same functionality These concepts are collectively known as the Unix philosophy Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike summarize this in The Unix Programming Environment as the idea that the power of a system comes more from the relationships among programs than from the programs themselves Unix operating systems are widely used in servers workstations and mobile devices The Unix environment and the client server program model were essential elements in the development of the Internet and the reshaping of computing as centered in networks rather than in individual computers Both Unix and the C programming language were developed by AT amp T and distributed to government and academic institutions which led to both being ported to a wider variety of machine families than any other operating system As a result Unix became synonymous with open systems citation needed Under Unix the operating system consists of many utilities along with the master control program the kernel The kernel provides services to start and stop programs handles the file system and other common low level tasks that most programs share and schedules access to avoid conflicts when programs try to access the same resource or device simultaneously To mediate such access the kernel has special rights reflected in the division between user space and kernel space The microkernel concept was introduced in an effort to reverse the trend towards larger kernels and return to a system in which most tasks were completed by smaller utilities In an era when a standard computer consisted of a hard disk for storage and a data terminal for input and output I O the Unix file model worked quite well as most I O was linear However modern systems include networking and other new devices As graphical user interfaces developed the file model proved inadequate to the task of handling asynchronous events such as those generated by a mouse In the s non blocking I O and the set of inter process communication mechanisms were augmented with Unix domain sockets shared memory message queues and semaphores Functions such as network protocols were moved out of the kernel History edit Main article History of Unix Ken Thompson sitting and Dennis Ritchie working together at a PDP The history of Unix dates back to the mid s when the Massachusetts Institute of Technology AT amp T Bell Labs and General Electric were developing an experimental time sharing operating system called Multics for the GE mainframe Multics introduced many innovations but had many problems Bell Labs frustrated by the size and complexity of Multics but not the aims slowly pulled out of the project Their last researchers to leave Multics Ken Thompson Dennis Ritchie M D McIlroy and J F Ossanna decided to redo the work on a much smaller scale The first production instance of Unix was installed in early at New York Telephone Co Systems Development Center under the direction of Dan Gielan In Unix was rewritten in the C programming language The migration from assembly to the higher level language C resulted in much more portable software requiring only a relatively small amount of machine dependent code to be replaced when porting Unix to other computing platforms Bell Labs produced several versions of Unix that are collectively referred to as Research Unix During the late s and early s the influence of Unix in academic circles led to large scale adoption of Unix BSD and System V by commercial startups some of the most notable of which are Sequent HP UX Solaris AIX and Xenix In the late s System V Release SVR was developed by AT amp T Unix System Laboratories and Sun Microsystems SVR was subsequently adopted by many commercial Unix vendors In the s Unix like systems grew in popularity as Linux and BSD distributions were developed through collaboration by a worldwide network of programmers Later Apple also released Darwin which became the core of the OS X operating system Standards edit The Common Desktop Environment CDE part of the COSE initiative Beginning in the late s an open operating system standardization effort now known as POSIX provided a common baseline for all operating systems IEEE based POSIX around the common structure of the major competing variants of the Unix system publishing the first POSIX standard in In the early s a separate but very similar effort was started by an industry consortium the Common Open Software Environment COSE initiative which eventually became the Single UNIX Specification administered by The Open Group Starting in the Open Group and IEEE started the Austin Group to provide a common definition of POSIX and the Single UNIX Specification In in an effort towards compatibility several Unix system vendors agreed on SVR s Executable and Linkable Format ELF as the standard for binary and object code files The common format allows substantial binary compatibility among Unix systems operating on the same CPU architecture The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard was created to provide a reference directory layout for Unix like operating systems and has mainly been used in Linux Components edit See also List of Unix programs The Unix system is composed of several components that are normally packaged together By including in addition to the kernel of an operating system the development environment libraries documents and the portable modifiable source code for all of these components Unix was a self contained software system This was one of the key reasons it emerged as an important teaching and learning tool and has had such a broad influence The inclusion of these components did not make the system large the original V UNIX distribution consisting of copies of all of the compiled binaries plus all of the source code and documentation occupied less than MB and arrived on a single track magnetic tape The printed documentation typeset from the on line sources was contained in two volumes The names and filesystem locations of the Unix components have changed substantially across the history of the system Nonetheless the V implementation is considered by many who to have the canonical early structure Kernel source code in usr sys composed of several sub components conf configuration and machine dependent parts including boot code dev device drivers for control of hardware and some pseudo hardware sys operating system kernel handling memory management process scheduling system calls etc h header files defining key structures within the system and important system specific invariables Development Environment Early versions of Unix contained a development environment sufficient to recreate the entire system from source code cc C language compiler first appeared in V Unix as machine language assembler for the machine ld linker for combining object files lib object code libraries installed in lib or usr lib libc the system library with C run time support was the primary library but there have always been additional libraries for such things as mathematical functions libm or database access V Unix introduced the first version of the modern Standard I O library stdio as part of the system library Later implementations increased the number of libraries significantly make build manager introduced in PWB UNIX for effectively automating the build process include header files for software development defining standard interfaces and system invariants Other languages V Unix contained a Fortran compiler a programmable arbitrary precision calculator bc dc and the awk scripting language and later versions and implementations contain many other language compilers and toolsets Early BSD releases included Pascal tools and many modern Unix systems also include the GNU Compiler Collection as well as or instead of a proprietary compiler system Other tools including an object code archive manager ar symbol table lister nm compiler development tools e g lex amp yacc and debugging tools Commands Unix makes little distinction between commands user level programs for system operation and maintenance e g cron commands of general utility e g grep and more general purpose applications such as the text formatting and typesetting package Nonetheless some major categories are sh The shell programmable command line interpreter the primary user interface on Unix before window systems appeared and even afterward within a command window Utilities the core tool kit of the Unix command set including cp ls grep find and many others Subcategories include System utilities administrative tools such as mkfs fsck and many others User utilities environment management tools such as passwd kill and others Document formatting Unix systems were used from the outset for document preparation and typesetting systems and included many related programs such as nroff troff tbl eqn refer and pic Some modern Unix systems also include packages such as TeX and Ghostscript Graphics The plot subsystem provided facilities for producing simple vector plots in a device independent format with device specific interpreters to display such files Modern Unix systems also generally include X as a standard windowing system and GUI and many support OpenGL Communications Early Unix systems contained no inter system communication but did include the inter user communication programs mail and write V introduced the early inter system communication system UUCP and systems beginning with BSD release c included TCP IP utilities Documentation Unix was the first operating system to include all of its documentation online in machine readable form The documentation included man manual pages for each command library component system call header file etc doc longer documents detailing major subsystems such as the C language and troff Impact edit See also Unix like Photo from USENIX including Dennis Ritchie center Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie being awarded the National Medal of Technology from Bill Clinton The Unix system had significant impact on other operating systems It won its success by Direct interaction Moving away from the total control of businesses like IBM and DEC citation needed AT amp T giving the software away at no cost Running on inexpensive hardware Being easy to adopt and move to different machines It was written in a high level language rather than assembly language which had been thought necessary for systems implementation on early computers Although this followed the lead of Multics and Burroughs it was Unix that popularized the idea Unix had a drastically simplified file model compared to many contemporary operating systems treating all kinds of files as simple byte arrays The file system hierarchy contained machine services and devices such as printers terminals or disk drives providing a uniform interface but at the expense of occasionally requiring additional mechanisms such as ioctl and mode flags to access features of the hardware that did not fit the simple stream of bytes model The Plan operating system pushed this model even further and eliminated the need for additional mechanisms Unix also popularized the hierarchical file system with arbitrarily nested subdirectories originally introduced by Multics Other common operating systems of the era had ways to divide a storage device into multiple directories or sections but they had a fixed number of levels often only one level Several major proprietary operating systems eventually added recursive subdirectory capabilities also patterned after Multics DEC s RSX M s group user hierarchy evolved into VMS directories CP M s volumes evolved into MS DOS subdirectories and HP s MPE group account hierarchy and IBM s SSP and OS library systems were folded into broader POSIX file systems Making the command interpreter an ordinary user level program with additional commands provided as separate programs was another Multics innovation popularized by Unix The Unix shell used the same language for interactive commands as for scripting shell scripts there was no separate job control language like IBM s JCL Since the shell and OS commands were just another program the user could choose or even write his own shell New commands could be added without changing the shell itself Unix s innovative command line syntax for creating modular chains of producer consumer processes pipelines made a powerful programming paradigm coroutines widely available Many later command line interpreters have been inspired by the Unix shell A fundamental simplifying assumption of Unix was its focus on newline delimited ASCII text for nearly all file formats There were no binary editors in the original version of Unix the entire system was configured using textual shell command scripts The common denominator in the I O system was the byte unlike record based file systems The focus on text for representing nearly everything made Unix pipes especially useful and encouraged the development of simple general tools that could be easily combined to perform more complicated ad hoc tasks The focus on text and bytes made the system far more scalable and portable than other systems Over time text based applications have also proven popular in application areas such as printing languages PostScript ODF and at the application layer of the Internet protocols e g FTP SMTP HTTP SOAP and SIP Unix popularized a syntax for regular expressions that found widespread use The Unix programming interface became the basis for a widely implemented operating system interface standard POSIX see above The C programming language soon spread beyond Unix and is now ubiquitous in systems and applications programming Early Unix developers were important in bringing the concepts of modularity and reusability into software engineering practice spawning a software tools movement Unix provided the TCP IP networking protocol on relatively inexpensive computers which contributed to the Internet explosion of worldwide real time connectivity and which formed the basis for implementations on many other platforms The Unix policy of extensive on line documentation and for many years ready access to all system source code raised programmer expectations and contributed to the launch of the free software movement Over time the leading developers of Unix and programs that ran on it established a set of cultural norms for developing software norms which became as important and influential as the technology of Unix itself this has been termed the Unix philosophy Free Unix and Unix like operating systems edit See also UNIX and UNIX like operating systems Debian GNU Linux a popular Unix like operating system FreeBSD a popular Unix like operating system In Richard Stallman announced the GNU project an ambitious effort to create a free software Unix like system free in that everyone who received a copy would be free to use study modify and redistribute it The GNU project s own kernel development project GNU Hurd had not produced a working kernel but in Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel as free software under the GNU General Public License In addition to their use in the Linux operating system many GNU packages such as the GNU Compiler Collection and the rest of the GNU toolchain the GNU C library and the GNU core utilities have gone on to play central roles in other free Unix systems as well Linux distributions consisting of the Linux kernel and large collections of compatible software have become popular both with individual users and in business Popular distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux Fedora SUSE Linux Enterprise openSUSE Debian GNU Linux Ubuntu Linux Mint Mandriva Linux Slackware Linux MEPIS and Gentoo A free derivative of BSD Unix BSD was released in and led to the NetBSD and FreeBSD projects With the settlement of a lawsuit brought against the University of California and Berkeley Software Design Inc USL v BSDi by UNIX Systems Laboratories it was clarified that Berkeley had the right to distribute BSD Unix for free if it so desired Since then BSD Unix has been developed in several different product branches including OpenBSD and DragonFly BSD Linux and BSD are increasingly filling the market needs traditionally served by proprietary Unix operating systems as well as expanding into new markets such as the consumer desktop and mobile and embedded devices Because of the modular design of the Unix model sharing components is relatively common consequently most or all Unix and Unix like systems include at least some BSD code and some systems also include GNU utilities in their distributions In a interview Dennis Ritchie clarified his opinion that Linux and BSD operating systems are a continuation of the basis of the Unix design and as derivatives of Unix I think the Linux phenomenon is quite delightful because it draws so strongly on the basis that Unix provided Linux seems to be the among the healthiest of the direct Unix derivatives though there are also the various BSD systems as well as the more official offerings from the workstation and mainframe manufacturers In the same interview he states that he views both Unix and Linux as the continuation of ideas that were started by Ken and me and many others many years ago OpenSolaris is a relatively recent addition to the list of operating systems based on free software licenses marked as such by FSF and OSI It includes a number of derivatives that combines CDDL licensed kernel and system tools and also GNU userland and is currently the only open source System V derivative available edit Main article Year problem Unix stores system time values as the number of seconds from midnight January the Unix Epoch in variables of type time t historically defined as signed long On January on bit Unix systems the current time will roll over from a zero followed by ones x FFFFFFF to a one followed by zeros x which will reset time to the year or depending on implementation because that toggles the sign bit Since times before are rarely represented in Unix time one possible solution that is compatible with existing binary formats would be to redefine time t as unsigned bit integer However such a kludge merely postpones the problem to February and could introduce bugs in software that computes time differences Some Unix versions have already addressed this For example in Solaris and Linux in bit mode time t is bits long meaning that the OS itself and bit applications will correctly handle dates for some billion years Existing bit applications using a bit time t continue to work on bit Solaris systems but are still prone to the problem Some vendors have introduced an alternative bit type and corresponding API without addressing uses of the standard time t The NetBSD Project decided to instead bump time t to bit in its th major release for both bit and bit architectures supporting bit time t in applications compiled for a former NetBSD release via its binary compatibility layer ARPANET edit In May RFC described the development of Network Unix by the Center for Advanced Computation at the University of Illinois The system was said to present several interesting capabilities as an ARPANET mini host At the time Unix required a license from Bell Laboratories that at US was very expensive for non university users while an educational license cost just It was noted that Bell was open to suggestions for an ARPANET wide license Specific features found beneficial were Local processing facilities Compilers Editor Document preparation system Efficient file system and access control Mountable and de mountable volumes Unified treatment of peripherals as special files The network control program NCP was integrated within the Unix file system Network connections treated as special files which can be accessed through standard Unix I O calls The system closes all files on program exit desirable to minimize the amount of code added to the basic Unix kernel Branding edit See also List of Unix systems Promotional license plate by Digital Equipment Corporation HP workstation running HP UX a certified Unix operating system In October Novell the company that owned the rights to the Unix System V source at the time transferred the trademarks of Unix to the X Open Company now The Open Group and in sold the related business operations to Santa Cruz Operation SCO Whether Novell also sold the copyrights to the actual software was the subject of a federal lawsuit SCO v Novell which Novell won The case was appealed but on Aug the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed the trial decisions closing the case Unix vendor SCO Group Inc accused Novell of slander of title The present owner of the trademark UNIX is The Open Group an industry standards consortium Only systems fully compliant with and certified to the Single UNIX Specification qualify as UNIX others are called Unix system like or Unix like By decree of The Open Group the term UNIX refers more to a class of operating systems than to a specific implementation of an operating system those operating systems which meet The Open Group s Single UNIX Specification should be able to bear the UNIX or UNIX trademarks today after the operating system s vendor pays a substantial certification fee and annual trademark royalties to The Open Group Systems licensed to use the UNIX trademark include AIX HP UX IRIX Solaris Tru formerly Digital UNIX A UX OS X and a part of z OS Sometimes a representation like Un x NIX or N X is used to indicate all operating systems similar to Unix This comes from the use of the asterisk and the question mark characters as wildcard indicators in many utilities This notation is also used to describe other Unix like systems e g Linux BSD etc that have not met the requirements for UNIX branding from the Open Group The Open Group requests that UNIX is always used as an adjective followed by a generic term such as system to help avoid the creation of a genericized trademark Unix was the original formatting but the usage of UNIX remains widespread because it was once typeset in small caps Unix according to Dennis Ritchie when presenting the original Unix paper to the third Operating Systems Symposium of the American Association for Computing Machinery ACM we had a new typesetter and troff had just been invented and we were intoxicated by being able to produce small caps Many of the operating system s predecessors and contemporaries used all uppercase lettering so many people wrote the name in upper case due to force of habit It is not an acronym Several plural forms of Unix are used casually to refer to multiple brands of Unix and Unix like systems Most common is the conventional Unixes but Unices treating Unix as a Latin noun of the third declension is also popular The pseudo Anglo Saxon plural form Unixen is not common although occasionally seen Trademark names can be registered by different entities in different countries and trademark laws in some countries allow the same trademark name to be controlled by two different entities if each entity uses the trademark in easily distinguishable categories The result is that Unix has been used as a brand name for various products including book shelves ink pens bottled glue
