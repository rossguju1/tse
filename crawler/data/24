csshover min htc Software From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation search For other uses see Software disambiguation This article needs additional citations for verification Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources Unsourced material may be challenged and removed September Computer software or simply software also known as computer programs is the non tangible component of computers Computer software contrasts with computer hardware which is the physical component of computers Computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be realistically used without the other Computer software includes all computer programs regardless of their architecture for example executable files libraries and scripts are computer software Yet it shares their mutual properties software consists of clearly defined instructions that upon execution instructs hardware to perform the tasks for which it is designed Software is stored in computer memory and cannot be touched just as a D model shown in an illustration cannot be touched At the lowest level executable code consists of machine language instructions specific to an individual processor typically a central processing unit CPU A machine language consists of groups of binary values signifying processor instructions that change the state of the computer from its preceding state For example an instruction may change the value stored in a particular storage location inside the computer an effect that is not directly observable to the user An instruction may also indirectly cause something to appear on a display of the computer system a state change which should be visible to the user The processor carries out the instructions in the order they are provided unless it is instructed to jump to a different instruction or interrupted Software is usually written in high level programming languages that are easier and more efficient for humans to use closer to natural language than machine language High level languages are compiled or interpreted into machine language object code Software may also be written in a low level assembly language essentially a vaguely mnemonic representation of a machine language using a natural language alphabet Assembly language is converted into object code via an assembler Contents History Types of software Purpose or domain of use Nature or domain of execution Programming tools Software topics Architecture Execution Quality and reliability License Patents Design and implementation Industry and organizations See also References External links History edit Main article History of software Types of software edit See also List of software categories A diagram showing how the operating system software and application software are layered on a typical desktop computer The arrows indicate information flow On virtually all computer platforms software can be grouped into a few broad categories Purpose or domain of use edit Based on the goal computer software can be divided into Application software uses the computer system to perform useful work or provide entertainment functions beyond the basic operation of the computer itself System software is designed to operate the computer hardware to provide basic functionality and to provide a platform for running application software System software includes Operating system an essential collection of computer programs that manages resources and provides common services for other software Supervisory programs boot loaders shells and window systems are core parts of operating systems In practice an operating system comes bundled with additional software including application software so that a user can potentially do some work with a computer that only has an operating system Device driver a computer program that operates or controls a particular type of device that is attached to a computer Each device needs at least one corresponding device driver thus a computer needs more than one device driver Utilities software designed to assist users in maintenance and care of their computers Malicious software or malware computer software developed to harm and disrupt computers As such malware is undesirable Malware is closely associated with computer related crimes though some malicious programs may have been designed as practical jokes Nature or domain of execution edit Desktop applications such as web browsers and Microsoft Office as well as smartphone and tablet applications called apps Server software Scripts such as JavaScript scripts are pieces of software traditionally embedded in web pages that are run directly inside the web browser when a web page is loaded without the need for a web browser plugin Software written in other programming languages can also be run within the web browser if the software is either translated into JavaScript or if a web browser plugin that supports that language is installed the most common example of the latter is ActionScript scripts which are supported by the Adobe Flash plugin Web applications usually run on the web server and output dynamically generated web pages to web browsers using e g PHP Java or ASP NET or even JavaScript that runs on the server in modern times they commonly include some JavaScript to be run in the web browser as well in which case they typically run partly on the server partly in the web browser Plugins and extensions are software that extends or modifies the functionality of another piece of software and require that software be used in order to function Embedded software resides as firmware within embedded systems devices dedicated to a single use or a few uses such as cars and televisions although some embedded devices such as wireless chipsets can themselves be part of an ordinary non embedded computer system such as a PC or smartphone In the embedded system context there is sometimes no clear distinction between the system software and the application software However some embedded systems run embedded operating systems and these systems do retain the distinction between system software and application software although typically there will only be one fixed application which is always ran Microcode is a special relatively obscure type of embedded software which tells the processor itself how to execute machine code so it is actually a lower level than machine code It is typically proprietary to the processor manufacturer and any necessary correctional microcode software updates are supplied by them to users which is much cheaper than shipping replacement processor hardware Thus an ordinary programmer would not expect to ever have to deal with it Programming tools edit Main article Programming tool Programming tools are software in the form of programs or applications that software developers also known as programmers coders hackers or software engineers use to create debug maintain i e improve or fix or otherwise support software Software is written in one or more programming languages there are many programming languages in existence and each has at least one implementation each of which consists of its own set of programming tools These tools may be relatively self contained programs such as compilers debuggers interpreters linkers and text editors that can be combined together to accomplish a task much as one might use multiple hand tools to fix a physical object or they may be an integrated development environment IDE which combines much or all of the functionality of such self contained tools An IDE may do this either by invoking the relevant individual tools on behalf of the programmer or by reimplementing their functionality in a new way Almost all programming language implementations a notable exception being Smalltalk provide the option of using individual tools rather than an IDE because some programmers prefer not to use IDEs for various reasons and IDEs usually take longer to be developed to an acceptable standard than individual tools indeed initially new programming languages which are created every year would not typically have IDEs available for them Software topics edit Architecture edit See also Software architecture Users often see things differently than programmers People who use modern general purpose computers as opposed to embedded systems analog computers and supercomputers usually see three layers of software performing a variety of tasks platform application and user software Platform software Platform includes the firmware device drivers an operating system and typically a graphical user interface which in total allow a user to interact with the computer and its peripherals associated equipment Platform software often comes bundled with the computer On a PC one will usually have the ability to change the platform software Application software Application software or Applications are what most people think of when they think of software Typical examples include office suites and video games Application software is often purchased separately from computer hardware Sometimes applications are bundled with the computer but that does not change the fact that they run as independent applications Applications are usually independent programs from the operating system though they are often tailored for specific platforms Most users think of compilers databases and other system software as applications User written software End user development tailors systems to meet users specific needs User software include spreadsheet templates and word processor templates Even email filters are a kind of user software Users create this software themselves and often overlook how important it is Depending on how competently the user written software has been integrated into default application packages many users may not be aware of the distinction between the original packages and what has been added by co workers Execution edit Main article Execution computing Computer software has to be loaded into the computer s storage such as the hard drive or memory Once the software has loaded the computer is able to execute the software This involves passing instructions from the application software through the system software to the hardware which ultimately receives the instruction as machine code Each instruction causes the computer to carry out an operation moving data carrying out a computation or altering the control flow of instructions Data movement is typically from one place in memory to another Sometimes it involves moving data between memory and registers which enable high speed data access in the CPU Moving data especially large amounts of it can be costly So this is sometimes avoided by using pointers to data instead Computations include simple operations such as incrementing the value of a variable data element More complex computations may involve many operations and data elements together Quality and reliability edit Main articles Software quality Software testing and Software reliability Software quality is very important especially for commercial and system software like Microsoft Office Microsoft Windows and Linux If software is faulty buggy it can delete a person s work crash the computer and do other unexpected things Faults and errors are called bugs Many bugs are discovered and eliminated debugged through software testing However software testing rarely if ever eliminates every bug some programmers say that every program has at least one more bug Lubarsky s Law All major software companies such as Microsoft Novell and Sun Microsystems have their own software testing departments with the specific goal of just testing Software can be tested through unit testing regression testing and other methods which are done manually or most commonly automatically since the amount of code to be tested can be quite large For instance NASA has extremely rigorous software testing procedures for many operating systems and communication functions Many NASA based operations interact and identify each other through command programs called software This enables many people who work at NASA to check and evaluate functional systems overall Programs containing command software enable hardware engineering and system operations to function much easier together License edit Main article Software license The software s license gives the user the right to use the software in the licensed environment Some software comes with the license when purchased off the shelf or an OEM license when bundled with hardware Other software comes with a free software license granting the recipient the rights to modify and redistribute the software Software can also be in the form of freeware or shareware Patents edit Main articles Software patent and Software patent debate Software can be patented in some but not all countries however software patents can be controversial in the software industry with many people holding different views about it The controversy over software patents is about specific algorithms or techniques that the software contains which may not be duplicated by others and considered intellectual property and copyright infringement depending on the severity Design and implementation edit Main articles Software development Computer programming and Software engineering Design and implementation of software varies depending on the complexity of the software For instance design and creation of Microsoft Word software will take much more time than designing and developing Microsoft Notepad because of the difference in functionalities in each one Software is usually designed and created coded written programmed in integrated development environments IDE like Eclipse Emacs and Microsoft Visual Studio that can simplify the process and compile the program As noted in different section software is usually created on top of existing software and the application programming interface API that the underlying software provides like GTK JavaBeans or Swing Libraries APIs are categorized for different purposes For instance JavaBeans library is used for designing enterprise applications Windows Forms library is used for designing graphical user interface GUI applications like Microsoft Word and Windows Communication Foundation is used for designing web services Underlying computer programming concepts like quicksort hash table array and binary tree can be useful to creating software When a program is designed it relies on the API For instance if a user is designing a Microsoft Windows desktop application he she might use the NET Windows Forms library to design the desktop application and call its APIs like Form Close and Form Show to close or open the application and write the additional operations him herself that it need to have Without these APIs the programmer needs to write these APIs him herself Companies like Sun Microsystems Novell and Microsoft provide their own APIs so that many applications are written using their software libraries that usually have numerous APIs in them Computer software has special economic characteristics that make its design creation and distribution different from most other economic goods specify A person who creates software is called a programmer software engineer or software developer terms that all have a similar meaning Industry and organizations edit Main article Software industry A great variety of software companies and programmers in the world comprise a software industry Software can be quite a profitable industry Bill Gates the founder of Microsoft was the richest person in the world in largely by selling the Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office software products The same goes for Larry Ellison largely through his Oracle database software Through time the software industry has become increasingly specialized Non profit software organizations include the Free Software Foundation GNU Project and Mozilla Foundation Software standard organizations like the W C IETF develop software standards so that most software can interoperate through standards such as XML HTML HTTP or FTP Other well known large software companies include Novell SAP Symantec Adobe Systems and Corel while small companies often provide innovation See also edit Software release life cycle List of software Software portal Free software portal Information technology portal References edit
