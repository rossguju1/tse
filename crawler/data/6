Stanford California Citizenship United States Fields Computer Science Institutions Bell Laboratories IBM Alma mater MIT Known for Samuel Checkers playing Program Notable awards Computer Pioneer Award Arthur Lee Samuel was an American pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence The Samuel Checkers playing Program appears to be the world s first self learning program and as such a very early demonstration of the fundamental concept of artificial intelligence AI Contents Biography Computer checkers draughts development References External links Biography edit Samuel was born in in Emporia Kansas and graduated from College of Emporia in Kansas in He received a Master s degree in Electrical Engineering from MIT in and taught for two years as instructor In he joined Bell Laboratories where he worked mostly on vacuum tubes including improvements of Radar during World War II He developed a gas discharge transmit receive switch TR tube that allowed a single antenna to be used for both transmitting and receiving After the war he moved to the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign where he initiated the ILLIAC project but left before its first computer was complete Samuel went to IBM in Poughkeepsie New York in where he would conceive and carry out his most successful work He is credited with one of the first software hash tables and influencing early research in using transistors for computers at IBM At IBM he made the first checkers program on IBM s first commercial computer the IBM The program was a sensational demonstration of the advances in both hardware and skilled programming and caused IBM s stock to increase points overnight His pioneering non numerical programming helped shaped the instruction set of processors as he was one of the first to work with computers on projects other than computation He was known for writing articles that made complex subjects easy to understand He was chosen to write an introduction to one of the earliest journals devoted to computing in In Samuel retired from IBM and became a professor at Stanford where he worked the remainder of his life He worked with Donald Knuth on the TeX project including writing some of the documentation He continued to write software past his th birthday He was given the Computer Pioneer Award by the IEEE Computer Society in He died of complications from Parkinson s disease on July Computer checkers draughts development edit Samuel is most known within the AI community for his groundbreaking work in computer checkers He thought that teaching computers to play games was very fruitful for developing tactics appropriate to general problems and he chose checkers because it is relatively simple but has a depth of strategy The main driver of the machine was a search tree of the board positions reachable from the current state Since he had only a very limited amount of available computer memory Samuel implemented what is now called alpha beta pruning Instead of searching each path until it came to the game s conclusion Samuel developed a scoring function based on the position of the board at any given time This function tried to measure the chance of winning for each side at the given position It took into account such things as the number of pieces on each side the number of kings and the proximity of pieces to being kinged The program chose its move based on a minimax strategy meaning it made the move that optimized the value of this function assuming that the opponent was trying to optimize the value of the same function from its point of view Samuel also designed various mechanisms by which his program could become better In what he called rote learning the program remembered every position it had already seen along with the terminal value of the reward function This technique effectively extended the search depth at each of these positions Samuel s later programs reevaluated the reward function based on input professional games He also had it play thousands of games against itself as another way of learning With all of this work Samuel s program reached a respectable amateur status and was the first to play any board game at this high a level He continued to work on checkers until the mid s at which point his program achieved sufficient skill to challenge a respectable amateur References edit a b c
