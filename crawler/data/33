from to and later moved to Long Island to preach to the Montauks Wheelock founded Moor s Indian Charity School in The Charity School proved somewhat successful but additional funding was necessary to continue school s operations and Wheelock sought the help of friends to raise money Occom accompanied by the Reverend Nathaniel Whitaker traveled to England in to raise money from churches With these funds they established a trust to help Wheelock The head of the trust was a Methodist named William Legge nd Earl of Dartmouth The Charter of Dartmouth College on display in Baker Memorial Library The Charter was signed on December on behalf of King George III of Great Britain Although the fund provided Wheelock ample financial support for the Charity School Wheelock had trouble recruiting Indians to the institution primarily because its location was far from tribal territories In seeking to expand the school into a college Wheelock relocated it to Hanover in the Province of New Hampshire The move from Connecticut followed a lengthy and sometimes frustrating effort to find resources and secure a charter The Royal Governor of New Hampshire John Wentworth provided the land upon which Dartmouth would be built and on December issued the charter in the name of King George III establishing the College That charter created a college for the education and instruction of Youth of the Indian Tribes in this Land and also of English Youth and any others The reference to educating Native American youth was included to connect Dartmouth to the Charity School and enable use of the

Wheelock primarily intended the college to educate White youth and the few Native students that attended Dartmouth experienced much difficulty in an institution ostensibly dedicated to their education The funds for the Charity School for Native Americans that preceded Dartmouth College were raised primarily by the efforts of a Native American named Samson Occom and at least some of those funds were used to help found the college The college graduated only Native Americans during its first two hundred years In the college established Native American academic and social programs as part of a new

changed to refer to women as well as men Seal edit Main article Seal of Dartmouth College Seal of Dartmouth College Dartmouth s royal charter required the creation of a seal for use on official documents and diplomas The college s founder Eleazar Wheelock designed a seal for his college bearing a striking resemblance to the seal of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel a missionary

other Affairs of Business of and concerning Dartmouth College On October the trustees affirmed the charter s reservation of the seal for official corporate documents alone The College Publications Committee commissioned noted typographer W A Dwiggins to create a line drawing version of the seal in that saw widespread use Dwiggins design was modified during to change the date from to to accord with the date of the college charter The trustees commissioned a new set of dies with a date of to replace the old dies now badly worn after almost two hundred years of use The design continues to be used under trademark number Shield edit On October the trustees approved a Dartmouth College Shield for general use Artist and engraver W Parke Johnson designed this emblem on the basis of the shield that is depicted at the center of the original seal This design does not survive On June the trustees approved another coat of arms based on the shield part of the seal this one by Canadian artist and designer Thoreau MacDonald That design was used widely and like Dwiggins seal had its date changed from to around That version continues to be used under trademark registration number and others College designer John Scotford made a stylized version of the shield during the s but it did not see the success of MacDonald s design The shield appears to have been used as the basis of the shield of Dartmouth Medical School and it has been reproduced in sizes as small as micrometers across The design has appeared on Rudolph Ruzicka s Bicentennial Medal Philadelphia Mint and elsewhere Nickname symbol and mascot edit Keggy posing on the Dartmouth College Green Dartmouth has never had an official mascot The nickname The Big Green originating in the s is based on students adoption of a shade of forest green Dartmouth Green as the school s official color in Beginning in the s the Dartmouth College athletic teams were known by their unofficial nickname the Indians a moniker that probably originated among sports journalists This unofficial mascot and team name was used until the early s when its use came under criticism In the Trustees declared the use of the Indian symbol in any form to be inconsistent with present institutional and academic objectives of the College in advancing Native American education Some alumni and students as well as the conservative student newspaper The Dartmouth Review have sought to return the Indian symbol to prominence but no team has worn the symbol on its uniform in decades Various student initiatives have been undertaken to adopt a new mascot but none has become official One proposal devised by the college humor magazine the Dartmouth Jack O Lantern was Keggy the Keg an anthropomorphic beer keg who makes occasional appearances at college sporting events Despite student enthusiasm for Keggy the mascot has only received approval from the student government In November student government attempted to revive the Dartmoose as a potential replacement amid renewed controversy surrounding the former Indian mascot Alumni edit Main article List of Dartmouth College alumni Dartmouth s alumni are known for their devotion to the college Most
