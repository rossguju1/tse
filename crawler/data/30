csshover min htc Associative array From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation search Dictionary data structure redirects here It is not to be confused with data dictionary In computer science an associative array map symbol table or dictionary is an abstract data type composed of a collection of pairs such that each possible key appears at most once in the collection Operations associated with this data type allow the addition of pairs to the collection the removal of pairs from the collection the modification of the values of existing pairs the lookup of the value associated with a particular key The dictionary problem is the task of designing a data structure that implements an associative array A standard solution to the dictionary problem is a hash table in some cases it is also possible to solve the problem using directly addressed arrays binary search trees or other more specialized structures Many programming languages include associative arrays as primitive data types and they are available in software libraries for many others Content addressable memory is a form of direct hardware level support for associative arrays Associative arrays have many applications including such fundamental programming patterns as memoization and the decorator pattern Contents Operations Example Implementation Language support See also References External links Operations edit In an associative array the association between a key and a value is often known as a binding and the same word binding may also be used to refer to the process of creating a new association The operations that are usually defined for an associative array are Add or insert add a new pair to the collection binding the new key to its new value The arguments to this operation are the key and the value Reassign replace the value in one of the pairs that are already in the collection binding an old key to a new value As with an insertion the arguments to this operation are the key and the value Remove or delete remove a pair from the collection unbinding a given key from its value The argument to this operation is the key Lookup find the value if any that is bound to a given key The argument to this operation is the key and the value is returned from the operation If no value is found some associative array implementations raise an exception In addition associative arrays may also include other operations such as determining the number of bindings or constructing an iterator to loop over all the bindings Usually for such an operation the order in which the bindings are returned may be arbitrary A multimap generalizes an associative array by allowing multiple values to be associated with a single key A bidirectional map is a related abstract data type in which the bindings operate in both directions each value must be associated with a unique key and a second lookup operation takes a value as argument and looks up the key associated with that value Example edit Suppose that the set of loans made by a library is to be represented in a data structure Each book in a library may be checked out only by a single library patron at a time However a single patron may be able to check out multiple books Therefore the information about which books are checked out to which patrons may be represented by an associative array in which the books are the keys and the patrons are the values For instance using notation from Python or JSON JavaScript Object Notation in which a binding is represented by placing a colon between the key and the value the current checkouts may be represented by an associative array Great Expectations John Pride and Prejudice Alice Wuthering Heights Alice A lookup operation with the key Great Expectations in this array would return the name of the person who checked out that book John If John returns his book that would cause a deletion operation in the associative array and if Pat checks out another book that would cause an insertion operation leading to a different state Pride and Prejudice Alice The Brothers Karamazov Pat Wuthering Heights Alice In this new state the same lookup as before with the key Great Expectations would raise an exception because this key is no longer present in the array Implementation edit For dictionaries with very small numbers of bindings it may make sense to implement the dictionary using an association list a linked list of bindings With this implementation the time to perform the basic dictionary operations is linear in the total number of bindings however it is easy to implement and the constant factors in its running time are small Another very simple implementation technique usable when the keys are restricted to a narrow range of integers is direct addressing into an array the value for a given key k is stored at the array cell A k or if there is no binding for k then the cell stores a special sentinel value that indicates the absence of a binding As well as being simple this technique is fast each dictionary operation takes constant time However the space requirement for this structure is the size of the entire keyspace making it impractical unless the keyspace is small The most frequently used general purpose implementation of an associative array is with a hash table an array of bindings together with a hash function that maps each possible key into an array index The basic idea of a hash table is that the binding for a given key is stored at the position given by applying the hash function to that key and that lookup operations are performed by looking at that cell of the array and using the binding found there However hash table based dictionaries must be prepared to handle collisions that occur when two keys are mapped by the hash function to the same index and many different collision resolution strategies have been developed for dealing with this situation often based either on open addressing looking at a sequence of hash table indices instead of a single index until finding either the given key or an empty cell or on hash chaining storing a small association list instead of a single binding in each hash table cell Dictionaries may also be stored in binary search trees or in data structures specialized to a particular type of keys such as radix trees tries Judy arrays or van Emde Boas trees but these implementation methods are less efficient than hash tables as well as placing greater restrictions on the types of data that they can handle The advantages of these alternative structures come from their ability to handle operations beyond the basic ones of an associative array such as finding the binding whose key is the closest to a queried key when the query is not itself present in the set of bindings Language support edit Main article Comparison of programming languages mapping Associative arrays can be implemented in any programming language as a package and many language systems provide them as part of their standard library In some languages they are not only built into the standard system but have special syntax often using array like subscripting Built in syntactic support for associative arrays was introduced by SNOBOL under the name table MUMPS made multi dimensional associative arrays optionally persistent its key data structure SETL supported them as one possible implementation of sets and maps Most modern scripting languages starting with AWK and including Perl Tcl JavaScript Python Ruby and Lua support associative arrays as a primary container type In many more languages they are available as library functions without special syntax In Smalltalk Objective C NET Python and REALbasic they are called dictionaries in Perl and Ruby they are called hashes in C Java Go Clojure Scala OCaml Haskell they are called maps see map C unordered map C and Map in Common Lisp and Windows PowerShell they are called hash tables since both typically use this implementation In PHP all arrays can be associative except that the keys are limited to integers and strings In JavaScript see also JSON all objects behave as associative arrays In Lua they are called tables and are used as the primitive building block for all data structures In Visual FoxPro they are called Collections See also edit Computer programming portal Tuple Function mathematics Key value
