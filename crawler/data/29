For the magazine see Computing magazine For the scientific journal see Computing journal A difference engine computing the solution to a polynomial function Computer laboratory Moody Hall James Madison University A rack of servers from Computing is any goal oriented activity requiring benefiting from or creating algorithmic processes e g through computers Computing includes designing developing and building hardware and software systems processing structuring and managing various kinds of information doing scientific research on and with computers making computer systems behave intelligently and creating and using communications and entertainment media Field of computing include computer engineering software engineering computer science information systems and information technology Contents Definitions History of computing Computer Computer software and hardware Application software System software Computer network Internet Computer user End user Computer programming Computer programmer Computer industry Software industry Sub disciplines of computing Computer engineering Software engineering Computer science Information systems Information technology Systems administration See also References External links Definitions edit The ACM Computing Curricula defined computing as follows In a general way we can define computing to mean any goal oriented activity requiring benefiting from or creating computers Thus computing includes designing and building hardware and software systems for a wide range of purposes processing structuring and managing various kinds of information doing scientific studies using computers making computer systems behave intelligently creating and using communications and entertainment media finding and gathering information relevant to any particular purpose and so on The list is virtually endless and the possibilities are vast and it defines five sub disciplines of the computing field Computer Science Computer Engineering Information Systems Information Technology and Software Engineering However Computing Curricula also recognizes that the meaning of computing depends on the context Computing also has other meanings that are more specific based on the context in which the term is used For example an information systems specialist will view computing somewhat differently from a software engineer Regardless of the context doing computing well can be complicated and difficult Because society needs people to do computing well we must think of computing not only as a profession but also as a discipline The term computing has sometimes been narrowly defined as in a ACM report on Computing as a Discipline The discipline of computing is the systematic study of algorithmic processes that describe and transform information their theory analysis design efficiency implementation and application The fundamental question underlying all computing is What can be efficiently automated The term computing is also synonymous with counting and calculating In earlier times it was used in reference to mechanical computing machines History of computing edit Main articles History of computing and Timeline of computing The history of computing is longer than the history of computing hardware and modern computing technology and includes the history of methods intended for pen and paper or for chalk and slate with or without the aid of tables Computing is intimately tied to the representation of numbers But long before abstractions like the number arose there were mathematical concepts to serve the purposes of civilization These concepts include one to one correspondence the basis of counting comparison to a standard used for measurement and the right triangle a device for assuring a right angle The earliest known tool for use in computation was the abacus and it was thought to have been invented in Babylon circa BC Its original style of usage was by lines drawn in sand with pebbles Abaci of a more modern design are still used as calculation tools today This was the first known computer and most advanced system of calculation known to date preceding Greek methods by years Computer edit Main articles Computer Outline of computers and Glossary of computer terms A computer is a machine that manipulates data according to a set of instructions called a computer program The program has an executable form that the computer can use directly to execute the instructions The same program in its human readable source code form enables a programmer to study and develop the algorithm Because the instructions can be carried out in different types of computers a single set of source instructions converts to machine instructions according to the central processing unit type The execution process carries out the instructions in a computer program Instructions express the computations performed by the computer They trigger sequences of simple actions on the executing machine Those actions produce effects according to the semantics of the instructions Computer software and hardware edit Main articles Software and Computer hardware Computer software or just software is a collection of computer programs and related data that provides the instructions for telling a computer what to do and how to do it Software refers to one or more computer programs and data held in the storage of the computer for some purposes In other words software is a set of programs procedures algorithms and its documentation concerned with the operation of a data processing system Program software performs the function of the program it implements either by directly providing instructions to the computer hardware or by serving as input to another piece of software The term was coined to contrast with the old term hardware meaning physical devices In contrast to hardware software cannot be touched Software is also sometimes used in a more narrow sense meaning application software only Application software edit Main article Application software Application software also known as an application or an app is computer software designed to help the user to perform specific tasks Examples include enterprise software accounting software office suites graphics software and media players Many application programs deal principally with documents Apps may be bundled with the computer and its system software or may be published separately Some users are satisfied with the bundled apps and need never install one Application software is contrasted with system software and middleware which manage and integrate a computer s capabilities but typically do not directly apply them in the performance of tasks that benefit the user The system software serves the application which in turn serves the user Application software applies the power of a particular computing platform or system software to a particular purpose Some apps such as Microsoft Office are available in versions for several different platforms others have narrower requirements and are thus called for example a Geography application for Windows or an Android application for education or Linux gaming Sometimes a new and popular application arises that only runs on one platform increasing the desirability of that platform This is called a killer application System software edit Main article System software System software or systems software is computer software designed to operate and control the computer hardware and to provide a platform for running application software System software includes operating systems utility software device drivers window systems and firmware Frequently development tools such as compilers linkers and debuggers are classified as system software Computer network edit Main article Computer network A computer network often simply referred to as a network is a collection of hardware components and computers interconnected by communication channels that allow sharing of resources and information Where at least one process in one device is able to send receive data to from at least one process residing in a remote device then the two devices are said to be in a network Networks may be classified according to a wide variety of characteristics such as the medium used to transport the data communications protocol used scale topology and organizational scope Communications protocols define the rules and data formats for exchanging information in a computer network and provide the basis for network programming Well known communications protocols are Ethernet a hardware and Link Layer standard that is ubiquitous in local area networks and the Internet Protocol Suite which defines a set of protocols for internetworking i e for data communication between multiple networks as well as host to host data transfer and application specific data transmission formats Computer networking is sometimes considered a sub discipline of electrical engineering telecommunications computer science information technology or computer engineering since it relies upon the theoretical and practical application of these disciplines Internet edit The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that use the standard Internet protocol suite TCP IP to serve billions of users that consists of millions of private public academic business and government networks of local to global scope that are linked by a broad array of electronic wireless and optical networking technologies The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services such as the inter linked hypertext documents of the World Wide Web WWW and the infrastructure to support email Computer user edit Main article User computing who uses a computer or network service A user often has a user account and is identified by a username also user name screen name also screenname nickname also nick or handle which derives from the identical Citizen s Band radio term In hacker related terminology users are divided into lusers and power users citation needed In projects where the system actor is another system or a software agent there may be no end user In that case the end users for the system is indirect end users End user edit Main article End user The term end user refers to the ultimate operator of a piece of software but it is also a concept in software engineering referring to an abstraction of that group of end users of computers i e the expected user or target user The term is used to distinguish those who only operate the software from the developer of the system who knows a programming language and uses it to create new functions for end users Computer programming edit Main articles Computer programming and Software engineering Computer programming in general is the process of writing testing debugging and maintaining the source code and documentation of computer programs This source code is written in a programming language which is an artificial language often more restrictive or demanding than natural languages but easily translated by the computer The purpose of programming is to invoke the desired behavior customization from the machine The process of writing high quality source code requires knowledge of both the application s domain and the computer science domain The highest quality software is thus developed by a team of various domain experts each person a specialist in some area of development But the term programmer may apply to a range of program quality from hacker to open source contributor to professional And a single programmer could do most or all of the computer programming needed to generate the proof of concept to launch a new killer application Computer programmer edit Main articles Programmer Software engineer and Software developer A programmer computer programmer or coder is a person who writes computer software The term computer programmer can refer to a specialist in one area of computer programming or to a generalist who writes code for many kinds of software One who practices or professes a formal approach to programming may also be known as a programmer analyst A programmer s primary computer language C C Java Lisp Python Smalltalk etc is often prefixed to the above titles and those who work in a web environment often prefix their titles with web The term programmer can be used to refer to a software developer software engineer computer scientist or software analyst However members of these professions typically citation needed possess other software engineering skills beyond programming for this reason the term programmer is sometimes considered an insulting or derogatory oversimplification of these other professions citation needed Computer industry edit Main article Computer industry The computer industry is made up of all of the businesses involved in developing computer software designing computer hardware and computer networking infrastructures the manufacture of computer components and the provision of information technology services including system administration and maintenance Software industry edit Main article Software industry The software industry includes businesses engaged in development maintenance and publication of software The industry also includes software services such as training documentation and consulting Sub disciplines of computing edit Computer engineering edit Main article Computer engineering Computer engineering is a discipline that integrates several fields of Electrical engineering and computer science required to develop computer hardware and software Computer engineers usually have training in electronic engineering or electrical engineering software design and hardware software integration instead of only software engineering or electronic engineering Computer engineers are involved in many hardware and software aspects of computing from the design of individual microprocessors personal computers and supercomputers to circuit design This field of engineering not only focuses on how computer systems themselves work but also how they integrate into the larger picture Software engineering edit Main article Software engineering Software engineering SE is the application of a systematic disciplined quantifiable approach to the design development operation and maintenance of software and the study of these approaches that is the application of engineering to software In layman s terms it is the act of using insights to conceive model and scale a solution to a problem The first reference to the term is the NATO Software Engineering Conference and was meant to provoke thought regarding the perceived software crisis at the time Software development a much used and more generic term does not necessarily subsume the engineering paradigm The generally accepted concepts of Software Engineering as an engineering discipline have been specified in the Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge SWEBOK The SWEBOK has become an internationally accepted standard ISO IEC TR Computer science edit Main articles Computer science and Computer scientist Computer science or computing science abbreviated CS or Comp Sci is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications A computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems Its subfields can be divided into practical techniques for its implementation and application in computer systems and purely theoretical areas Some such as computational complexity theory which studies fundamental properties of computational problems are highly abstract while others such as computer graphics emphasize real world applications Still others focus on the challenges in implementing computations For example programming language theory studies approaches to description of computations while the study of computer programming itself investigates various aspects of the use of programming languages and complex systems and human computer interaction focuses on the challenges in making computers and computations useful usable and universally accessible to humans Information systems edit Main article Information systems Information systems IS is the study of complementary networks of hardware and software see information technology that people and organizations use to collect filter process create and distribute data The study bridges business and computer science using the theoretical foundations of information and computation to study various business models and related algorithmic processes within a computer science discipline Computer Information System s CIS is a field studying computers and algorithmic processes including their principles their software and hardware designs their applications and their impact on society while IS emphasizes functionality over design Information technology edit Main article Information technology Information technology IT is the application of computers and telecommunications equipment to store retrieve transmit and manipulate data often in the context of a business or other enterprise The term is commonly used as a synonym for computers and computer networks but it also encompasses other information distribution technologies such as television and telephones Several industries are associated with information technology such as computer hardware software electronics semiconductors internet telecom equipment e commerce and computer services Systems administration edit Main article System administrator A system administrator IT systems administrator systems administrator or sysadmin is a person employed to maintain and operate a computer system and or network The duties of a system administrator are wide ranging and vary widely from one organization to another Sysadmins are usually charged with installing supporting and maintaining servers or other computer systems and planning for and responding to service outages and other problems Other duties may include scripting or light programming project management for systems related projects supervising or training computer operators and being the consultant for computer problems beyond the knowledge of technical support staff See also edit
