November In computer science linear search or sequential search is a method for finding a particular value in a list that consists of checking every one of its elements one at a time and in sequence until the desired one is found Linear search is the simplest search algorithm it is a special case of brute force search Its worst case cost is proportional to the number of elements in the list and so is its expected cost if all list elements are equally likely to be searched for Therefore if the list has more than a few elements other methods such as binary search or hashing will be faster but they also impose additional requirements Contents Analysis Non uniform probabilities Application Pseudocode Forward iteration Recursive version Searching in reverse order Using a sentinel Linear search on an ordered list See also References External links Analysis edit For a list with n items the best case is when the value is equal to the first element of the list in which case only one comparison is needed The worst case is when the value is not in the list or occurs only once at the end of the list in which case n comparisons are needed If the value being sought occurs k times in the list and all orderings of the list are equally likely the expected number of comparisons is For example if the value being sought occurs once in the list and all orderings of the list are equally likely the expected number of comparisons is However if it is known that it occurs once then at most n comparisons are needed and the expected number of comparisons is for example for n this is corresponding to a single if then else construct Either way asymptotically the worst case cost and the expected cost of linear search are both O n Non uniform probabilities edit The performance of linear search improves if the desired value is more likely to be near the beginning of the list than to its end Therefore if some values are much more likely to be searched than others it is desirable to place them at the beginning of the list In particular when the list items are arranged in order of decreasing probability and these probabilities are geometrically distributed the cost of linear search is only O If the table size n is large enough linear search will be faster than binary search whose cost is O log n Application edit Linear search is usually very simple to implement and is practical when the list has only a few elements or when performing a single search in an unordered list When many values have to be searched in the same list it often pays to pre process the list in order to use a faster method For example one may sort the list and use binary search or build any efficient search data structure from it Should the content of the list change frequently repeated re organization may be more trouble than it is worth As a result even though in theory other search algorithms may be faster than linear search for instance binary search in practice even on medium sized arrays around items or less it might be infeasible to use anything else On larger arrays it only makes sense to use other faster search methods if the data is large enough because the initial time to prepare sort the data is comparable to many linear searches Pseudocode edit Forward iteration edit This pseudocode describes a typical variant of linear search where the result of the search is supposed to be either the location of the list item where the desired value was found or an invalid location to indicate that the desired element does not occur in the list For each item in the list if that item has the desired value stop the search and return the item s location Return In this pseudocode the last line is executed only after all list items have been examined with none matching If the list is stored as an array data structure the location may be the index of the item found usually between and n or and n In that case the invalid location can be any index before the first element such as or respectively or after the last one n or n respectively If the list is a simply linked list then the item s location is its reference and is usually the null pointer Recursive version edit Linear search can also be described as a recursive algorithm LinearSearch value list if the list is empty return else if the first item of the list has the desired value return its location else return LinearSearch value remainder of the list Searching in reverse order edit Linear search in an array is usually programmed by stepping up an index variable until it reaches the last index This normally requires two comparison instructions for each list item one to check whether the index has reached the end of the array and another one to check whether the item has the desired value In many computers one can reduce the work of the first comparison by scanning the items in reverse order Suppose an array A with elements indexed to n is to be searched for a value x The following pseudocode performs a forward search returning n if the value is not found Set i to Repeat this loop If i gt n then exit the loop If A i x then exit the loop Set i to i Return i The following pseudocode searches the array in the reverse order returning when the element is not found Set i to n Repeat this loop If i then exit the loop If A i x then exit the loop Set i to i Return i Most computers have a conditional branch instruction that tests the sign of a value in a register or the sign of the result of the most recent arithmetic operation One can use that instruction which is usually faster than a comparison against some arbitrary value requiring a subtraction to implement the command If i then exit the loop This optimization is easily implemented when programming in machine or assembly language That branch instruction is not directly accessible in typical high level programming languages although many compilers will be able to perform that optimization on their own Using a sentinel edit Another way to reduce the overhead is to eliminate all checking of the loop index This can be done by inserting the desired item itself as a sentinel value at the far end of the list as in this pseudocode Set A n to x Set i to Repeat this loop If A i x then exit the loop Set i to i Return i With this stratagem it is not necessary to check the value of i against the list length n even if x was not in A to begin with the loop will terminate when i n However this method is possible only if the array slot A n exists but is not being otherwise used Similar arrangements could be made if the array were to be searched in reverse order and element A were available Although the effort avoided by these ploys is tiny it is still a significant component of the overhead of performing each step of the search which is small Only if many elements are likely to be compared will it be worthwhile considering methods that make fewer comparisons but impose other requirements Linear search on an ordered list edit For ordered lists that must be accessed sequentially such as linked lists or files with variable length records lacking an index the average performance can be improved by giving up at the first element which is greater than the unmatched target value rather than examining the entire list If the list is stored as an ordered array then binary search is almost always more efficient than linear search as with n gt say unless there is some reason to suppose that most searches will be for the small elements near the start of the sorted list See also edit Ternary search Hash table
