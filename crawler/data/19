encyclopedia Redirected from Denial of service attack Jump to navigation search DoS redirects here For other uses see DOS disambiguation DDoS Stacheldraht Attack diagram In computing a denial of service DoS or distributed denial of service DDoS attack is an attempt to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users Although the means to carry out motives for and targets of a DoS attack may vary it generally consists of efforts to temporarily or indefinitely interrupt or suspend services of a host connected to the Internet As clarification DDoS Distributed Denial of Service attacks are sent by two or more persons or bots See botnet DoS Denial of Service attacks are sent by one person or system Perpetrators of DoS attacks typically target sites or services hosted on high profile web servers such as banks credit card payment gateways and even root nameservers DoS threats are also common in business and are sometimes responsible for website attacks This technique has now seen extensive use in certain games used by server owners or disgruntled competitors on games such as server owners popular Minecraft servers Increasingly DoS attacks have also been used as a form of resistance Richard Stallman has stated that DoS is a form of Internet Street Protests The term is generally used relating to computer networks but is not limited to this field for example it is also used in reference to CPU resource management One common method of attack involves saturating the target machine with external communications requests so much so that it cannot respond to legitimate traffic or responds so slowly as to be rendered essentially unavailable Such attacks usually lead to a server overload In general terms DoS attacks are implemented by either forcing the targeted computer s to reset or consuming its resources so that it can no longer provide its intended service or obstructing the communication media between the intended users and the victim so that they can no longer communicate adequately Denial of service attacks are considered violations of the Internet Architecture Board s Internet proper use policy and also violate the acceptable use policies of virtually all Internet service providers They also commonly constitute violations of the laws of individual nations Contents Symptoms and manifestations Methods of attack

attacks Backscatter Legality See also Notes and references Further reading External links Symptoms and manifestations edit The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team US CERT defines symptoms of denial of service attacks to include Unusually slow network performance opening files or accessing web sites Unavailability of a particular web site Inability to access any web site Dramatic increase in the number of spam emails received this type of DoS attack is considered an e mail bomb Disconnection of a wireless or wired internet connection Long term denial of access to the web or any internet services Denial of service attacks can also lead to problems in the network branches around the actual computer being attacked For example the bandwidth of a router between the Internet and a LAN may be consumed by an attack compromising not only the intended computer but also the entire network or other computers on the LAN If the attack is conducted on a sufficiently large scale entire geographical regions of Internet connectivity can be compromised without the attacker s knowledge or intent by incorrectly configured or flimsy network infrastructure equipment Methods of attack edit A denial of service attack is characterized by an explicit attempt by attackers to prevent legitimate users of a service from using that service There are two general forms of DoS attacks those that crash services and those that flood services A DoS attack can be perpetrated in a number of ways Attacks can fundamentally be classified into five families Consumption of computational resources such as bandwidth memory disk space or processor time Disruption of configuration information such as routing information Disruption of state information such as unsolicited resetting of TCP sessions Disruption of physical network components Obstructing the communication media between the intended users and the victim so that they can no longer communicate adequately A DoS attack may include execution of malware intended to citation needed Max out the processor s usage preventing any work from occurring Trigger errors in the microcode of the machine Trigger errors in the sequencing of instructions so as to force the computer into an unstable state or lock up Exploit errors in the operating system causing resource starvation and or thrashing i e to use up all available facilities so no real work can be accomplished or it can crash the system itself Crash the operating system itself In most cases DoS attacks involve forging of IP sender addresses IP address spoofing so that the location of the attacking machines cannot easily be identified and to prevent filtering of the packets based on the source address Internet Control Message Protocol ICMP flood edit See also Smurf attack Ping flood and Ping of death A smurf attack is one particular variant of a flooding DoS attack on the public Internet It relies on misconfigured network devices that allow packets to be sent to all computer hosts on a particular network via the broadcast address of the network rather than a specific machine The network then serves as a smurf amplifier In such an attack the perpetrators will send large numbers of IP packets with the source address faked to appear to be the address of the victim The network s bandwidth is quickly used up preventing legitimate packets from getting through to their destination To combat denial of service attacks on the Internet services like the Smurf Amplifier Registry have given network service providers the ability to identify misconfigured networks and to take appropriate action such as filtering Ping flood is based on sending the victim an overwhelming number of ping packets usually using the ping command from Unix like hosts the t flag on Windows systems is much less capable of overwhelming a target also the l size flag does not allow sent packet size greater than in Windows It is very simple to launch the primary requirement being access to greater bandwidth than the victim Ping of death is based on sending the victim a malformed ping packet which might lead to a system crash S SYN flood edit See also SYN flood A SYN flood occurs when a host sends a flood of TCP SYN packets often with a forged sender address Each of these packets is handled like a connection request causing the server to spawn a half open connection by sending back a TCP SYN ACK packet Acknowledge and waiting for a packet in response from the sender address response to the ACK Packet However because the sender address is forged the response never comes These half open connections saturate the number of available connections the server is able to make keeping it from responding to legitimate requests until after the attack ends Teardrop attacks edit A teardrop attack involves sending mangled IP fragments with overlapping over sized payloads to the target machine This can crash various operating systems because of a bug in their TCP IP fragmentation re assembly code Windows x Windows and Windows NT operating systems as well as versions of Linux prior to versions and are vulnerable to this attack Around September a vulnerability in Windows Vista was referred to as a teardrop attack but the attack targeted SMB which is a higher layer than the TCP packets that teardrop used Peer to peer attacks edit Attackers have found a way to exploit a number of bugs in peer to peer servers to initiate DDoS attacks The most aggressive of these peer to peer DDoS attacks exploits DC Peer to peer attacks are different from regular botnet based attacks With peer to peer there is no botnet and the attacker does not have to communicate with the clients it subverts Instead the attacker acts as a puppet master instructing clients of large peer to peer file sharing hubs to disconnect from their peer to peer network and to connect to the victim s website instead As a result several thousand computers may aggressively try to connect to a target website While a typical web server can handle a few hundred connections per second before performance begins to degrade most web servers fail almost instantly under five or six thousand connections per second With a moderately large peer to peer attack a site could potentially be hit with up to connections in short order The targeted web server will be plugged up by the incoming connections While peer to peer attacks are easy to identify with signatures the large number of IP addresses that need to be blocked often over during the course of a large scale attack means that this type of attack can overwhelm mitigation defenses Even if a mitigation device can keep blocking IP addresses there are other problems to consider For instance there is a brief moment where the connection is opened on the server side before the signature itself comes through Only once the connection is opened to the server can the identifying signature be sent and detected and the connection torn down Even tearing down connections takes server resources and can harm the server This method of attack can be prevented by specifying in the peer to peer protocol which ports are allowed or not If port is not allowed the possibilities for attack on websites can be very limited Asymmetry of resource utilization in starvation attacks edit An attack which is successful in consuming resources on the victim computer must be either carried out by an attacker with greater resources by either controlling a computer with greater computation power or more commonly large network bandwidth controlling a large number of computers and directing them to attack as a group A DDoS attack is the primary example of this taking advantage of a property of the operating system or applications on the victim system which enables an attack consuming vastly more of the victim s resources than the attacker s an asymmetric attack Smurf attack SYN flood Sockstress and NAPTHA attack are all asymmetric attacks An attack may utilize a combination of these methods in order to magnify its power Permanent denial of service attacks edit A permanent denial of service PDoS also known loosely as phlashing is an attack that damages a system so badly that it requires replacement or reinstallation of hardware Unlike the distributed denial of service attack a PDoS attack exploits security flaws which allow remote administration on the management interfaces of the victim s hardware such as routers printers or other networking hardware The attacker uses these vulnerabilities to replace a device s firmware with a modified corrupt or defective firmware image a process which when done legitimately is known as flashing This therefore bricks the device rendering it unusable for its original purpose until it can be repaired or replaced The PDoS is a pure hardware targeted attack which can be much faster and requires fewer resources than using a botnet in a DDoS attack Because of these features and the potential and high probability of security exploits on Network Enabled Embedded Devices NEEDs this technique has come to the attention of numerous hacker communities PhlashDance is a tool created by Rich Smith an employee of Hewlett Packard s Systems Security Lab used to detect and demonstrate PDoS vulnerabilities at the EUSecWest Applied Security Conference in London Application level floods edit Various DoS causing exploits such as buffer overflow can cause server running software to get confused and fill the disk space or consume all available memory or CPU time Other kinds of DoS rely primarily on brute force flooding the target with an overwhelming flux of packets oversaturating its connection bandwidth or depleting the target s system resources Bandwidth saturating floods rely on the attacker having higher bandwidth available than the victim a common way of achieving this today is via Distributed Denial of Service employing a botnet Other floods may use specific packet types or connection requests to saturate finite resources by for example occupying the maximum number of open connections or filling the victim s disk space with logs A banana attack is another particular type of DoS It involves redirecting outgoing messages from the client back onto the client preventing outside access as well as flooding the client with the sent packets An attacker with shell level access to a victim s computer may slow it until it is unusable or crash it by using a fork bomb A kind of application level DoS attack is XDoS or XML DoS which can be controlled by modern Web Application Firewalls WAFs Nuke edit A Nuke is an old denial of service attack against computer networks consisting of fragmented or otherwise invalid ICMP packets sent to the target achieved by using a modified ping utility to repeatedly send this corrupt data thus slowing down the affected computer until it comes to a complete stop A specific example of a nuke attack that gained some prominence is the WinNuke which exploited the vulnerability in the NetBIOS handler in Windows A string of out of band data was sent to TCP port of the victim s machine causing it to lock up and display a Blue Screen of Death BSOD HTTP POST DDOS attack edit First discovered in the HTTP POST attack sends a complete legitimate HTTP POST header which includes an Content Length field to specify the size of the message body to follow However the attacker then proceeds to send the actual message body at an extremely slow rate e g byte seconds Due to the entire message being correct and complete the target sever will attempt to obey the Content Length field in the header and wait for the entire body of the message to be transmitted hence slowing it down Further combined with the fact that Apache will by default accept requests up to GB in size this attack can be particularly powerful HTTP POST attacks are difficult to differentiate from legitimate connections and are therefore able to bypass some protection systems OWASP an open source web application security project has released an testing tool to test the security of servers against this type of attack R U Dead Yet RUDY edit This attack targets web applications by starvation of available sessions on the web server Much like Slowloris RUDY keeps sessions at halt using never ending POST transmissions and sending an arbitrarily large content length header value Slow Read attack edit Slow Read attack sends legitimate application layer requests but reads responses very slowly thus trying to exhaust the server s connection pool Slow reading is achieved by advertising very small number for the TCP Receive Window size and at the same time by emptying clients TCP receive buffer slowly That naturally ensures a very low data flow rate Distributed attack edit A D istributed D enial o f S ervice A ttack DDoS occurs when multiple systems flood the bandwidth or resources of a targeted system usually one or more web servers citation needed This is the result of multiple compromised systems for example a botnet flooding the targeted system with traffic When a server is overloaded with connections new connections can no longer be accepted The major advantages to an attacker of using a distributed denial of service attack are that multiple machines can generate more attack traffic than one machine multiple attack machines are harder to turn off than one attack machine and that the behavior of each attack machine can be stealthier making it harder to track and shut down These attacker advantages cause challenges for defense mechanisms For example merely purchasing more incoming bandwidth than the current volume of the attack might not help because the attacker might be able to simply add more attack machines Malware can carry DDoS attack mechanisms one of the better known examples of this was MyDoom Its DoS mechanism was triggered on a specific date and time This type of DDoS involved hardcoding the target IP address prior to release of the malware and no further interaction was necessary to launch the attack A system may also be compromised with a trojan allowing the attacker to download a zombie agent or the trojan may contain one Attackers can also break into systems using automated tools that exploit flaws in programs that listen for connections from remote hosts This scenario primarily concerns systems acting as servers on the web Stacheldraht is a classic example of a DDoS tool It utilizes a layered structure where the attacker uses a client program to connect to handlers which are compromised systems that issue commands to the zombie agents which in turn facilitate the DDoS attack Agents are compromised via the handlers by the attacker using automated routines to exploit vulnerabilities in programs that accept remote connections running on the targeted remote hosts Each handler can control up to a thousand agents In some cases a machine may become part of a DDoS attack with the owner s consent for example in Operation Payback organized by the group Anonymous These collections of systems compromisers are known as botnets DDoS tools like Stacheldraht still use classic DoS attack methods centered on IP spoofing and amplification like smurf attacks and fraggle attacks these are also known as bandwidth consumption attacks SYN floods also known as resource starvation attacks may also be used Newer tools can use DNS servers for DoS purposes Unlike MyDoom s DDoS mechanism botnets can be turned against any IP address Script kiddies use them to deny the availability of well known websites to legitimate users More sophisticated attackers use DDoS tools for the purposes of extortion even against their business rivals Simple attacks such as SYN floods may appear with a wide range of source IP addresses giving the appearance of a well distributed DoS These flood attacks do not require completion of the TCP three way handshake and attempt to exhaust the destination SYN queue or the server bandwidth Because the source IP addresses can be trivially spoofed an attack could come from a limited set of sources or may even originate from a single host Stack enhancements such as syn cookies may be effective mitigation against SYN queue flooding however complete bandwidth exhaustion may require involvement further explanation needed If an attacker mounts an attack from a single host it would be classified as a DoS attack In fact any attack against availability would be classed as a Denial of Service attack On the other hand if an attacker uses many systems to simultaneously launch attacks against a remote host this would be classified as a DDoS attack See also DDoS mitigation Reflected Spoofed attack edit A distributed denial of service attack may involve sending forged requests of some type to a very large number of computers that will reply to the requests Using Internet Protocol address spoofing the source address is set to that of the targeted victim which means all the replies will go to and flood the target This reflected attack form is sometimes called a DRDOS ICMP Echo Request attacks Smurf Attack can be considered one form of reflected attack as the flooding host s send Echo Requests to the broadcast addresses of mis configured networks thereby enticing hosts to send Echo Reply packets to the victim Some early DDoS programs implemented a distributed form of this attack Many services can be exploited to act as reflectors some harder to block than others DNS amplification attacks involve a new mechanism that increased the amplification effect using a much larger list of DNS servers than seen earlier SNMP and NTP can also be exploited as reflector in an amplification attack Telephony denial of service edit Voice over IP has made abusive origination of large numbers of telephone voice calls inexpensive and readily automated while permitting call origins to be misrepresented through caller ID spoofing According to the US Federal Bureau of Investigation TDoS has appeared as part of various fraudulent schemes A scammer contacts the victim s banker or broker impersonating the victim to request a funds transfer The banker s attempt to contact the victim for verification of the transfer fails as the victim s telephone lines are being flooded with thousands of bogus calls rendering the victim unreachable A scammer contacts consumers with a bogus claim to collect an outstanding payday loan for thousands of dollars When the consumer objects the scammer retaliates by flooding the victim s employer with thousands of automated calls In some cases displayed caller ID is spoofed to impersonate police or law enforcement agencies A scammer contacts consumers with a bogus debt collection demand and threatens to send police when the victim balks the scammer floods local police numbers with calls on which caller ID is spoofed to display the victims number Police soon arrive at the victim s residence attempting to find the origin of the calls Telephony denial of service can exist even without Internet telephony In the New Hampshire Senate election phone jamming scandal telemarketers were used to flood political opponents with spurious calls to jam phone banks on election day Widespread publication of a number can also flood it with enough calls to render it unusable as happened with multiple area code subscribers inundated by hundreds of misdialed calls daily in response to a popular song Jenny TDoS differs from other telephone harassment such as prank calls and obscene phone calls by the number of calls originated by occupying lines continuously with repeated automated calls the victim is prevented from making or receiving both routine and emergency telephone calls Related exploits include SMS flooding attacks and black fax or fax loop transmission Unintentional denial of service edit This describes a situation where a website ends up denied not due to a deliberate attack by a single individual or group of individuals but simply due to a sudden enormous spike in popularity This can happen when an extremely popular website posts a prominent link to a second less well prepared site for example as part of a news story The result is that a significant proportion of the primary site s regular users potentially hundreds of thousands of people click that link in the space of a few hours having the same effect on the target website as a DDoS attack A VIPDoS is the same but specifically when the link was posted by a celebrity When Michael Jackson died in websites such as Google and Twitter slowed down or even crashed Many sites servers thought the requests were from a virus or spyware trying to cause a Denial of Service attack warning users that their queries looked like automated requests from a computer virus or spyware application News sites and link sites sites whose primary function is to provide links to interesting content elsewhere on the Internet are most likely to cause this phenomenon The canonical example is the Slashdot effect when receiving traffic from Slashdot Sites such as Reddit Digg the Drudge Report Fark Something Awful and the webcomic Penny Arcade have their own corresponding effects known as the Reddit hug of death the Digg effect being drudged farking goonrushing and wanging respectively Routers have also been known to create unintentional DoS attacks as both D Link and Netgear routers have created NTP vandalism by flooding NTP servers without respecting the restrictions of client types or geographical limitations Similar unintentional denials of service can also occur via other media e g when a URL is mentioned on television If a server is being indexed by Google or another search engine during peak periods of activity or does not have a lot of available bandwidth while being indexed it can also experience the effects of a DoS attack citation needed Legal action has been taken in at least one such case In Universal Tube amp Rollform Equipment Corporation sued YouTube massive numbers of would be youtube com users accidentally typed the tube company s URL utube com As a result the tube company ended up having to spend large amounts of money on upgrading their bandwidth The company appears to have taken advantage of the situation with utube com now containing ads for advertisement revenue In March after Malaysia Airlines Flight went missing DigitalGlobe launched a crowdsourcing service on which users could help search for the missing jet in satellite images The response overwhelmed the company s servers Denial of Service Level II edit The goal of DoS L possibly DDoS attack is to cause a launching of a defense mechanism which blocks the network segment from which the attack originated In case of distributed attack or IP header modification that depends on the kind of security behavior it will fully block the attacked network from Internet but without system crash Performing DoS attacks edit A wide array of programs are used to launch DoS attacks Most of these programs are completely focused on performing DoS attacks while others are also true Packet injectors able to perform other tasks as well Such tools are intended for benign use but they can also be utilized in launching attacks on victim networks Handling edit Defensive responses to Denial of Service attacks typically involves the use of a combination of attack detection traffic classification and response tools aiming to block traffic that they identify as illegitimate and allow traffic that they identify as legitimate A list of prevention and response tools is provided below Firewalls edit Firewalls can be set up to have simple rules such to allow or deny protocols ports or IP addresses In the case of a simple attack coming from a small number of unusual IP addresses for instance one could put up a simple rule to drop all incoming traffic from those attackers More complex attacks will however be hard to block with simple rules for example if there is an ongoing attack on port web service it is not possible to drop all incoming traffic on this port because doing so will prevent the server from serving legitimate traffic Additionally firewalls may be too deep in the network hierarchy Routers may be affected before the traffic gets to the firewall Nonetheless firewalls can effectively prevent users from launching simple flooding type attacks from machines behind the firewall Some stateful firewalls like OpenBSD s pf packet filter can act as a proxy for connections the handshake is validated with the client instead of simply forwarding the packet to the destination It is available for other BSDs as well In that context it is called synproxy Switches edit Most switches have some rate limiting and ACL capability Some switches provide automatic and or system wide rate limiting traffic shaping delayed binding TCP splicing deep packet inspection and Bogon filtering bogus IP filtering to detect and remediate denial of service attacks through automatic rate filtering and WAN Link failover and balancing citation needed These schemes will work as long as the DoS attacks are something that can be prevented by using them For example SYN flood can be prevented using delayed binding or TCP splicing Similarly content based DoS may be prevented using deep packet inspection Attacks originating from dark addresses or going to dark addresses can be prevented using Bogon filtering Automatic rate filtering can work as long as you have set rate thresholds correctly and granularly Wan link failover will work as long as both links have DoS DDoS prevention mechanism citation needed Routers edit Similar to switches routers have some rate limiting and ACL capability They too are manually set Most routers can be easily overwhelmed under a DoS attack Cisco IOS has features that prevent flooding i e example settings Application front end hardware edit Application front end hardware is intelligent hardware placed on the network before traffic reaches the servers It can be used on networks in conjunction with routers and switches Application front end hardware analyzes data packets as they enter the system and then identifies them as priority regular or dangerous There are more than bandwidth management vendors IPS based prevention edit Intrusion prevention systems IPS are effective if the attacks have signatures associated with them However the trend among the attacks is to have legitimate content but bad intent Intrusion prevention systems which work on content recognition cannot block behavior based DoS attacks citation needed An ASIC based IPS may detect and block denial of service attacks because they have the processing power and the granularity to analyze the attacks and act like a circuit breaker in an automated way citation needed A rate based IPS RBIPS must analyze traffic granularly and continuously monitor the traffic pattern and determine if there is traffic anomaly It must let the legitimate traffic flow while blocking the DoS attack traffic DDS based defense edit More focused on the problem than IPS a DoS Defense System DDS is able to block connection based DoS attacks and those with legitimate content but bad intent A DDS can also address both protocol attacks such as Teardrop and Ping of death and rate based attacks such as ICMP floods and SYN floods Blackholing and sinkholing edit With blackholing all the traffic to the attacked DNS or IP address is sent to a black hole null interface or a non existent server To be more efficient and avoid affecting network connectivity it can be managed by the ISP Sinkholing routes traffic to a valid IP address which analyzes traffic and rejects bad packets Sinkholing is not efficient for most severe attacks Clean pipes edit All traffic is passed through a cleaning center or a scrubbing center via various methods such as proxies tunnels or even direct circuits which separates bad traffic DDoS and also other common internet attacks and only sends good traffic beyond to the server The provider needs central connectivity to the Internet to manage this kind of service unless they happen to be located within the same facility as the cleaning center or scrubbing center Prolexic Technologies Tata Communications AT amp T and Verisign are examples of providers of this service Side effects of DoS attacks edit Backscatter edit See also Backscatter email and Internet background noise In computer network security backscatter is a side effect of a spoofed denial of service attack In this kind of attack the attacker spoofs or forges the source address in IP packets sent to the victim In general the victim machine cannot distinguish between the spoofed packets and legitimate packets so the victim responds to the spoofed packets as it normally would These response packets are known as backscatter If the attacker is spoofing source addresses randomly the backscatter response packets from the victim will be sent back to random destinations This effect can be used by network telescopes as indirect evidence of such attacks The term backscatter analysis refers to observing backscatter packets arriving at a statistically significant portion of the IP address space to determine characteristics of DoS attacks and victims Legality edit This section requires expansion January In the Police and Justice Act the United Kingdom specifically outlawed denial of service attacks and set a maximum penalty of years in prison In the US denial of service attacks may be considered a federal crime under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act with penalties that include years of imprisonment Many other countries have similar laws The US situation is under court ruling with a case in California On January Anonymous posted a petition on the whitehouse gov site asking that DDoS be recognized as a legal form of protest similar to the Occupy protests See also edit Billion laughs Black fax Cybercrime Dosnet Industrial espionage Intrusion detection system LAND LOIC Network
