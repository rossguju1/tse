encyclopedia Jump to navigation search Hash collision resolved by linear probing interval Open addressing or closed hashing is a method of collision resolution in hash tables With this method a hash collision is resolved by probing or searching through alternate locations in the array the probe sequence until either the target record is found or an unused array slot is found which indicates that there is no such key in the table Well known probe sequences include Linear probing in which the interval between probes is fixed often at Quadratic probing in which the interval between probes increases linearly hence the indices are described by a quadratic function Double hashing in which the interval between probes is fixed for each record but is computed by another hash function The main tradeoffs between these methods are that linear probing has the best cache performance but is most sensitive to clustering while double hashing has poor cache performance but exhibits virtually no clustering quadratic probing falls in between in both areas Double hashing can also require more computation than other forms of probing Some open addressing methods such as last come first served hashing and cuckoo hashing move existing keys around in the array to make room for the new key This gives better maximum search times than the methods based on probing A critical influence on performance of an open addressing hash table is the load factor that is the proportion of the slots in the array that are used As the load factor increases towards the number of probes that may be required to find or insert a given key rises dramatically Once the table becomes full probing algorithms may even fail to terminate Even with good hash functions load factors are normally limited to A poor hash function can exhibit poor performance even at very low load factors by generating significant clustering What causes hash functions to cluster is not well understood citation needed and it is easy to unintentionally write a hash function which causes severe clustering Example pseudo code edit The following pseudocode is an implementation of an open addressing hash table with linear probing and single slot stepping a common approach that is effective if the hash function is good Each of the lookup set and remove functions use a common internal function find slot to locate the array slot that either does or should contain a given key record pair key value var pair array slot num slots function find slot key i hash key modulo num slots search until we either find the key or find an empty slot while slot i is occupied and slot i key key i i modulo num slots return i function lookup key i find slot key if slot i is occupied key is in table return slot i value else key is not in table return not found function set key value i find slot key if slot i is occupied we found our key slot i value value return if the table is almost full rebuild the table larger note i find slot key slot i key key slot i value value Another example showing open addressing technique Presented function is converting each part of an internet protocol address where NOT XOR OR and AND are bitwise operations and lt lt and gt gt are left and right logical shifts key key key key are following digit numbers parts of ip address xxx xxx xxx xxx function ip key parts j do key key lt lt key key key lt lt key key j OR key gt gt key j key XOR j key key AND prime prime is a prime number j j while collision return key note Rebuilding the table requires allocating a larger array and recursively using the set operation to insert all the elements of the old array into the new larger array It is common to increase the array size exponentially for example by doubling the old array size function remove key i find slot key if slot i is unoccupied return key is not in the table j i loop mark slot i as unoccupied r note j j modulo num slots if slot j is unoccupied exit loop k hash slot j key modulo num slots k lies cyclically in i j i k j j i k or k j i if i lt j i lt k amp amp k lt j i lt k k lt j goto r slot i slot j i j note For all records in a cluster there must be no vacant slots between their natural hash position and their current position else lookups will terminate before finding the record At this point in the pseudocode i is a vacant slot that might be invalidating this property for subsequent records in the cluster j is such a subsequent record k is the raw hash where the record at j would naturally land in the hash table if there were no collisions This test is asking if the record at j is invalidly positioned with respect to the required properties of a cluster now that i is vacant Another technique for removal is simply to mark the slot as deleted However this eventually requires rebuilding the table simply to remove deleted records The methods above provide O updating and removal of existing records with occasional rebuilding if the high water mark of the table size grows The O remove method above is only possible in linearly probed hash tables with single slot stepping In the case where many records are to be deleted in one operation marking the slots for deletion and later rebuilding may be more efficient See also edit Lazy deletion a method of deleting from a hash table using open addressing References edit
