either by rewriting the how to content or by moving it to Wikiversity Wikibooks or Wikivoyage April Quadratic probing is an open addressing scheme in computer programming for resolving collisions in hash tables when an incoming data s hash value indicates it should be stored in an already occupied slot or bucket Quadratic probing operates by taking the original hash index and adding successive values of an arbitrary quadratic polynomial until an open slot is found For a given hash value the indices generated by linear probing are as follows This method results in primary clustering and as the cluster grows larger the search for those items hashing within the cluster becomes less efficient An example sequence using quadratic probing is Quadratic probing can be a more efficient algorithm in a closed hash table since it better avoids the clustering problem that can occur with linear probing although it is not immune It also provides good memory caching because it preserves some locality of reference however linear probing has greater locality and thus better cache performance Quadratic probing is used in the Berkeley Fast File System to allocate free blocks The allocation routine chooses a new cylinder group when the current is nearly full using quadratic probing because of the speed it shows in finding unused cylinder groups Contents Quadratic function Quadratic

Alternating sign See also References External links Quadratic function edit Let h k be a hash function that maps an element k to an integer in m where m is the size of the table Let the i th probe position for a value k be given by the function where c If c then h k i degrades to a linear probe For a given hash table the values of c and c remain constant Examples If then the probe sequence will be For m n a good choice for the constants are c c as the values of h k i for i in m are all distinct This leads to a probe sequence of where the values increase by For prime m gt most choices of c and c will make h k i distinct for i in m Such choices include c c c c and c c Because there are only about m distinct probes for a given element it is difficult to guarantee that insertions will succeed when the load factor is gt Quadratic probing insertion edit The problem here is to insert a key at an available key space in a given Hash Table using quadratic probing Algorithm to insert key in hash table edit Get the key k Set counter j Compute hash function h k k SIZE If hashtable h k is empty Insert key k at hashtable h k Stop Else The key space at hashtable h k is occupied so we need to find the next available key space Increment j Compute new hash function h k k j j SIZE Repeat Step till j is equal to the SIZE of hash table The hash table is full Stop C function for key insertion edit int quadratic probing insert int hashtable int key int empty hashtable is an integer hash table empty is another array which indicates whether the key space is occupied If an empty key space is found the function returns the index of the bucket where the key is inserted otherwise it returns if no empty key space is found int j hk hk key SIZE while j lt SIZE if empty hk hashtable hk key empty hk return hk j hk key j j SIZE return Quadratic probing search edit Algorithm to search element in hash table edit Get the key k to be searched Set counter j Compute hash function h k k SIZE If the key space at hashtable h k is occupied Compare the element at hashtable h k with the key k If they are equal The key is found at the bucket h k Stop Else The element might be placed at the next location given by the quadratic function Increment j Compute new hash function h k k j j SIZE Repeat Step till j is greater than SIZE of hash table The key was not found in the hash table Stop C function for key searching edit int quadratic probing search int hashtable int key int empty If the key is found in the hash table the function returns the index of the hashtable where the key is inserted otherwise it returns if the key is not found int j hk hk key SIZE while j lt SIZE if empty hk amp amp hashtable hk key return hk j hk key j j SIZE return Limitations edit For linear probing it is a bad idea to let the hash table get nearly full because performance is degraded as the hash table gets filled In the case of quadratic probing the situation is even more drastic With the exception of the triangular number case for a power of two sized hash table there is no guarantee of finding an empty cell once the table gets more than half full or even before the table gets half full if the table size is not prime This is because at most half of the table can be used as alternative locations to resolve collisions If the hash table size is b a prime greater than it can be proven that the first alternative locations including the initial location h k are all distinct and unique Suppose we assume two of the alternative locations to be given by and where x y b If these two locations point to the same key space but x y Then the following would have to be true As b table size is a prime greater than either x y or x y has to be equal to zero Since x and y are unique x y cannot be zero Also since x y b x y cannot be zero Thus by contradiction it can be said that the first b alternative locations after h k are unique So an empty key space can always be found as long as at most b locations are filled i e the hash table is not more than half full Alternating sign edit If the sign of the offset is alternated e g etc and if the number of buckets is a prime number p congruent to modulo i e one of and so on then the first p offsets will be unique modulo p In other words a permutation of through p is obtained and consequently a free bucket will always be found as long as there exists at least one The insertion algorithm only receives a minor modification but do note that SIZE has to be a suitable prime number as explained above Get the key k Set counter j Compute hash function h k k SIZE If hashtable h k is empty Insert key k at hashtable h k Stop Else The key space at hashtable h k is occupied so we need to find the next available key space Increment j Compute new hash function h k If j is odd then h k k j j SIZE else h k k j j SIZE Repeat Step till j is equal to the SIZE of hash table The hash table is full Stop The search algorithm is modified
